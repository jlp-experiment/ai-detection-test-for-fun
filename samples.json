    "text": "*This should not be possible*, Gunnery Sergeant Karim Poole thought, staring at the little stowaway. \nThe girl stared back at him, lower lip trembling, a curl of dark hair stuck to a teary cheek. \u201cHave you seen my mommy?\u201d She backed into the corner between the glossy white rib of the corridor and the matte wall, looking as if she might flee if he gave the wrong answer.\n*Ah, fuck, why me? I\u2019m absolute dogshit with kids*. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d he told her, wincing at how awkward and unconvincing it came out. *What on Blessed Earth are you doing here, anyway?*\nHow did a little girl somehow get onto a warship in deep cover in contested space? Even if she\u2019d somehow made it into the docking facility on a base, they\u2019d been out here for months. Who had she survived all this time without being discovered? \nWhat had she been *eating*? \nIt was a silly question to be obsessed with, but it was the one he couldn\u2019t get out of his head. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sweetie?\u201d he asked. It didn\u2019t sound any more natural than the last time he\u2019d spoken. \n\u201cKel,\u201d she quavered.\n*Oh, shit,* please *don\u2019t start crying again, kid*. \u201cThat\u2019s a great name,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cMy best friend\u2019s name is Kel.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a common name. At least this gave him something to talk about. \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s go find her and she can help us find your mom.\u201d\nShe sniffled.\nKel, his best friend and occasional lover, seemed like she\u2019d be good with kids. It wasn\u2019t really something you could really know about your crewmates, seeing as this sort of years-long mission didn\u2019t really give you a chance to watch anyone interact with minors, but she seemed like she\u2019d be good with kids. At least, she was certain to be better than him. \nThe little girl considered him, chewing a nail. \n\u201cCome on, just follow me,\u201d he urged her, and turned toward the crew quarters. Neither of them were on duty, and his wristlet showed Kel in the lounge when he queried it. \nHe turned back when she didn\u2019t respond, to make sure she was following, and froze.\nThe p-way was empty.\n\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d he grumbled out loud, stopping himself before voicing the profanity. There wasn\u2019t anywhere she could go that he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her. The passageway curved very slightly, but he didn\u2019t think a kid that small could run fast enough to get out of his sightline. He\u2019d only been facing away from her for a few seconds. All of the rooms required a scan to open the doors, and her biometrics wouldn\u2019t be in the system. There was nowhere she could have gone.\nThe ever-present hum of the p-way seemed very loud.\nThe ribs weren\u2019t wide enough for her to fully hide behind, but he strode back along the corridor anyway, checking behind each one. \nAs he approached a crossway, he heard crying. *How did you get all the way over here so fast, kiddo?*\nHe turned into the crossway and froze. \nIt wasn\u2019t the little girl. \nIt was Kel. \n\u201cKel?\u201d he whispered. \nShe didn\u2019t look up. She had her arms folded against the bulkhead, face buried in them, sobbing. Her tight cap of dark curls looked waterlogged, as if she\u2019d just gotten out of the shower.\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cKel?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t seem to hear him. \nHe took a tentative step toward her. Kel was not the sort of person who sobbed in passageways. Something must be really wrong. \nShe finally looked up at him, or that\u2019s what he thought at first. Her face was livid, eyes reddened. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare walk away from me,\u201d she snarled.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not,\u201d he blurted. \u201cKel, are you okay? I\u2019m not walking away from you. I\u2019m right here.\u201d\nShe bared her teeth. \u201cIf you leave, now, don\u2019t think you\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Clearly, something was very wrong with her. \u201cKel, take a breath and talk to me.\u201d\n\u201cI mean it.\u201d \nA tingle of unease worked its way up his spine. He was no longer sure she was looking at him, or that she was even seeing him. She seemed to be looking past him.\nHe turned. \nThe passageway behind him was empty. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going\u2014?\u201d he started to ask as he turned back to her. \nThe passageway in front of him was also empty.\n*What the absolute fucking FUCK.*\nThe hum of the p-way seemed very loud.\nThe storage deck was always quiet. He\u2019d come down here to get some board games out of his unit, but on second thought, he didn\u2019t really need them. *I can come back for them another time. Right now, I just want to be where there are a lot of other people*.\nHe turned back to head to the lift. And maybe to Medical. \nAnd then he heard it behind him. \n*Don\u2019t do it. Your mind\u2019s playing some kind of trick on you. There\u2019s no way there could be a little girl on this ship, and if that was Kel, the best thing you can do for her is get her some formal help*. \nThe crying grew louder. \n*Fuck.* He stopped walking. *No. Ignore it. Straight to Medical.* Almost despite himself, he turned around. \nAn elderly woman lay on the deck, struggling feebly. \n*She might not even be real.* \n\u201cHello?\u201d he called. \u201cMa\u2019am, do you need medical assistance?\u201d\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d she wheezed. \u201cSomeone help me.\u201d\nAs if something else was dragging him toward her, he took a step forward. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some help, ma\u2019am. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\nShe groaned, putting a hand to her side. \u201cMy name is Kel Danvers. Please, can anyone hear me? I need help.\u201d\nIt felt like his skin was frozen and cracking. *This isn\u2019t possible.*\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she pled.\n*Nope. Absolutely not. Fuck all this.* He turned and ran all the way to the lift. He couldn\u2019t run inside the lift, so he paced back and forth until the door opened, then ran toward Medical. \nHe\u2019d almost made it there when he collided bodily with Private First-Class Andre Ortega. \n\u201cChrist,\u201d Ortega swore, then turned red. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d\n\u201cMy fault,\u201d Karim choked out. \n\u201cDid you hear? About the thing they found? That\u2019s why we changed course. We\u2019re orbiting it.\u201d\n*Just get out of my way, kid. I need my head examined.* \u201cWhat thing?\u201d he asked wearily.\n\u201cThe\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to call it, sir. I was on the bridge taking lunch orders when they spotted it, so I saw it. On the screen, I mean. We weren\u2019t close enough yet to see it out the portholes.\u201d \n\u201cSpit it out, Private,\u201d Karim snapped. \u201cWhat kind of thing are you talking about it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a\u2026 It looks sort of gold-colored. It\u2019s like a\u2026 honeycomb? It\u2019s geometric. And huge. Much bigger than the ship.\u201d\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard about it,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cLook, Ortega, I\u2019m not feeling well. I\u2019m on my way to Medical. I\u2019ll be eager to hear all about it after I get checked out.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, sir. I hope you feel better soon.\u201d Ortega stepped aside, smiling nervously, his big front teeth flashing. \nKarim managed to fend off several other conversations on his way into Medical.\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, Poole?\u201d the doctor asked. He was younger than Karim generally liked his doctors to be, but he had the gruff lack of bedside manner Karim associated with medical competence, so he felt reality settling back into its normal patterns.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m seeing things, Doc. I was down in storage and I\u2014 I saw people who couldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re off-duty,\u201d the doctor observed. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d\nKarim shook his head. \nThe doctor eyed him, his long dark eyes narrowing. \u201cDon\u2019t panic, Poole. The combination of space and stress does strange things to the human mind, especially when you\u2019re out here for more than a few months. You wouldn\u2019t be the first person on this ship to see things that aren\u2019t there. It doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with you that sleep aids and some R&R won\u2019t fix. We\u2019ll do a full scan, make sure there\u2019s nothing more than that going on, but that\u2019s probably all it is.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Doc.\u201d He let out a long breath. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d \n\u201cStay off the storage deck for a while.\u201d The doctor grinned at him. \u201cIt\u2019s eerie down there even when we\u2019re not in deep space. Stay up here where it\u2019s brightly lit and busy until you\u2019re feeling back to normal. Doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\u201cAye-aye, sir.\u201d \n\u201cGood. Let\u2019s get you that scan.\u201d The doctor turned back to the desk in the exam room, hitting the nurse call-button. \u201cWe\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d\nA red light above the door began flashing, and what sounded like an alarm rang shrilly.\nThere was a soft knock at the door.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d the doctor called.\nThe door opened partially and a nurse stuck his head into the space. \u201cDoc, we\u2019ve got a medical emergency. Someone was out doing external maintenance and got her leg caught in a hinge. It seems like it\u2019s mangled pretty bad, and her comms cut out, so she was out there for a while. Her suit didn\u2019t rupture, but she passed out.\u201d\nThe doctor pushed himself to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019ve told them to prep the surgery pod?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll head to the prep room.\u201d\n\u201cPoole, I\u2019ll put in an order relieving you from duty for the next couple weeks. Can you come back tomorrow for a scan?\u201d\n\u201cSure, Doc.\u201d He hesitated, then turned to the nurse, compelled by an odd chill that felt almost like a premonition. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you tell me who was injured?\u201d\nThe nurse looked at the doctor, who shrugged permission. \u201cIt was Staff Sergeant Kel Danvers.\u201d",

    "text": "Look at this stupid girl, out in the middle of the night in a blizzard, her horse floundering through chest-high snowdrifts, in the dark and the freezing cold, riding like her life depends on it. Two girls, actually, because her maid Cecelia is too brave and too loyal for her own good. \nI guess she\u2019s not really a girl. She\u2019s a full-grown woman, dashing impetuously through the storm, but we\u2019re always youngest in our most desperate moments. \nThat\u2019s me, or rather it was me, a long time ago. On my way to try to save the man I love. \nOn Christmas, of all nights. \nActually, forget all that \u201cpoor girl\u201d stuff. Let\u2019s spare a minute to consider that poor horse. His name was Jonquil, and he didn\u2019t deserve to be caught up in any of this. He certainly hadn\u2019t married a man who got him into disaster after disaster, and he certainly didn\u2019t decide he couldn\u2019t accept being a widow and that he needed to take extreme measures to avoid it. He could have bucked me off into the snow and headed for the nearest village where some peasant would have been delighted to receive him as a mysterious Christmas gift. But he didn\u2019t. He just fought his way through that snow, probably whinnying *Winnie, what have you gotten us into?* under his breath.\nOh, come on, how dangerous could it be, I bet you\u2019re asking, riding a horse in the snow? You should probably consider, before you get too skeptical that I was in any real peril, that back in the day you could die from a paper cut. Everything was trying to kill us. These days people hear about our average lifespans and like to think that in my era, you were ancient at 30. That wasn\u2019t true. It\u2019s not how averages work. You were still a fairly young adult at 30, and we had our share of people in their 70s and 80s and even a handful who made it to their 90s. We didn\u2019t age faster. Most of us just died young. If plague or wounds or brigands didn\u2019t get us, politics was always waiting on the scaffold with a bloody axe in its hands. \nDon\u2019t worry, the girl\u2019s going to make it to London safely, despite the foolhardiness of undertaking a month-long, 350-mile ride in the brutal Scottish winter. At least this fool was hardy, although it did take quite a toll on her health. She\u2019ll make it all the way to the court of George I, the Protestant pretender, where she\u2019ll plead with him not to kill her husband, and he\u2019ll ignore her. She won\u2019t give up, on the tiles of his courtroom, as she clings to his robe and he drags her across the room, any more than she gave up in the snow and the dark and the biting wind. \n\u201cNever trust a Scot,\u201d Catherine Walpole sneered at me while her monarch tried to slink away with me still attached as firmly as a burr to his sleeve. \u201cShe\u2019s probably got a dagger up her sleeve.\u201d\nUp your sleeve is where you hide tricks, not dirks, you silly English bint. Not that you\u2019d know, since there\u2019s not a thought in your outrageously bewigged head besides extravagant clothes and jewels and who you\u2019re going to have your next affair with. What have you ever known about desperation? My knife was at my belt, of course, but there was no chance of using it successfully. I was already thinking, since this wasn\u2019t going well, about other things you could hide in clothing. *Vestis virum facit*, after all. \nMaybe she was right to pay so much attention to her dresses. Used correctly, a good dress can achieve things an army could never.\nWas he worth all this effort, you\u2019re probably wondering, before you\u2019ve even heard the half of it? \nI\u2019ve been called calculating, but the valuations of love are beyond my skill. I have no idea. He was the source of almost all of my misery and I wouldn\u2019t change a minute of it. \nWe were young when I met. Not for the time\u2014I was 19, which wasn\u2019t young at all to be married, but I don\u2019t know if that means I had good judgment. \nIf you\u2019re wondering what it was that convinced me, well, a good Catholic girl doesn\u2019t kiss and tell, but let me tell you: that kiss.\nWe were at the French court, and I was a charmer, so I had plenty to compare it to, but I\u2019ll leave all those liaisons dangereuses to the imagination. I was discreet, of course, being neither dummy nor dud. \nWe kissed, I fell under his spell, and the rest\u2014the parts that don\u2019t matter nearly as much\u2014is in the history books. Reader, I married him.\nHis name was William. William and Winifred. Willy and Winnie\u2014isn\u2019t that adorable? Or Will and Win, which makes us sound like quite the power couple. Never mind that it was his weakness of will that kept getting us in trouble, forcing me to find wins where I could manufacture them. And yet any time I tried to be firm with him, he\u2019d look at me with his sweet eyes and I\u2019d remember the boy I\u2019d kissed in the French court and my better sense would take wing. \nDepending on your perspective, I was either doomed by my family history to the sort of trouble he got me in, or I\u2019d seen enough of it that I should have known better. \nMy father got caught up in the anti-Catholic hysteria of his day and spent six awful years suffering in the Tower of London since they believed he\u2019d been involved in a Catholic plot to overthrow the British throne. According to gossips, my mother contrived a disastrously ill-conceived plot to free him, and got herself arrested for the trouble, although they were both freed eventually. \nIn truth, the only thing my mother did wrong was have too kind a heart. She gave money to Catholic prisoners, and the midwife who carried it to them for her got involved with a man named Thomas Dangerfield. Dangerfield lost his head (metaphorically) over my mother\u2019s almoner, and didn\u2019t take it well when she wasn\u2019t symmetrically smitten, which led him to fabricate a Catholic plot against the English throne just to implicate her, in which my mother almost lost her head (literally) before the whole thing got straightened out.\nNever trust a man with \u201cdanger\u201d in his name, says I. \nChildren should strive to succeed where their parents have failed, so instead of being an innocent freed from the Tower after being falsely accused of participation in a fake Catholic plot against the King of England, Willie and I participated in a real Catholic uprising against the king of England, trying to put a Scottish Catholic king in his place. Not to brag, but we got away Scot-free. \nIt wasn\u2019t just my parents, either, who were failing at being sensible role models.\nThe year after I got married, my older brother was languishing in Ghent because he was literally too gaunt and ill to leave, after being implicated in a Catholic plot to overthrow the British throne. You might recognize the name Ghent\u2014it\u2019s where John of Gaunt was from, one of the men that ultimately got us in all this king-switching trouble. From my lofty current perspective of being dead and all, I can tell you that in retrospect it probably would have been better for our sceptred isle to just wait out the snowballing disaster that was Richard II than to replace him, given the avalanche of problems that little well-intentioned endeavor ended up causing. But of course, hindsight is e\u2019er eagle-eyed. \nSpeaking of snowballs\u2026\nLet\u2019s return to that girl on her horse, in the seemingly endless darkness and cold and whirling snow, on Christmas Eve. \nWe\u2019ll get through all the history that got her there, and everything that came after, but she was still close enough to home that she could have turned back and let Providence handle events for itself. That was the moment, her heart quailing as the cold and hunger really sank in and poor faithful Jonquil stumbled in the snow like he might not make it to lodgings before winter took them all, that she decided what was most important to her. \nI\u2019m sorry. I just realized I haven\u2019t introduced her. Me. Being dead does tend to attenuate both your sense of time and your manners. \nMy name is Lady Winifred Maxwell, n\u00e9e Herbert, Countess of Nithsdale.\nI\u2019m most famous for breaking my husband, William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale, out of the Tower of London, but there\u2019s a lot more to me than that. \nAnd under all of it, the sartorial shell-games and popish plots, the midnight rides and French intrigues and long years in exile, this is a love story.

But of course, hindsight is e\u2019er eagle-eyed. \nSpeaking of snowballs\u2026\nLet\u2019s return to that girl on her horse, in the seemingly endless darkness and cold and whirling snow, on Christmas Eve. \nWe\u2019ll get through all the history that got her there, and everything that came after, but she was still close enough to home that she could have turned back and let Providence handle events for itself. That was the moment, her heart quailing as the cold and hunger really sank in and poor faithful Jonquil stumbled in the snow like he might not make it to lodgings before winter took them all, that she decided what was most important to her. \nI\u2019m sorry. I just realized I haven\u2019t introduced her. Me. Being dead does tend to attenuate both your sense of time and your manners. \nMy name is Lady Winifred Maxwell, n\u00e9e Herbert, Countess of Nithsdale.\nI\u2019m most famous for breaking my husband, William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale, out of the Tower of London, but there\u2019s a lot more to me than that. \nAnd under all of it, the sartorial shell-games and popish plots, the midnight rides and French intrigues and long years in exile, this is a love story.

    "text": "It is a sunny Thursday morning in April. Detective Benjamin Singer is attending a lecture for the first time in decades, and daydreaming about murder. \nThe environment is, to be fair, superbly suited to sending a mind off into the fields of imagination, to gather rosebuds or wool or\u2014in Singer\u2019s case\u2014darker mental artifacts. The building itself is a fantastic faux-medieval edifice with a mournful ecclesiastical air, its architecture doubtlessly intended to evoke lofty ideals of its lecture halls as \u201ccathedrals of learning,\u201d back a few centuries ago when people were willing to pay to build that sort of thing. The cloudy gothic-arched windows have a pleasant draping of wisteria vines which hover along the edges, the distortion of the aged and distorted glass giving them the appearance of flouncy green-and-purple valences. Inside, ancient radiators wheeze in a way that suggests the mechanical version of atherosclerosis, producing a soothing white-noise hiss. The air is laden with the olfactory equivalent of a sleepy academic hush: that strange and elusive scent that old buildings breathe forth when the sun heats their dust. The busy fingers of the students, trying to capture Professor Green\u2019s teachings, tap their laptop keys in a rhythmic susurrus. \nAll in all, it\u2019s a perfectly crafted environment for a daydream, a meditation, or even a nap\u2014not because it\u2019s boring, but simply because it\u2019s serene. \n\u201cIn the premodern world,\u201d Green is saying, \u201cjustice was not about rehabilitation. That\u2019s a very modern idea, very influenced by western ideas of individualism. We see the criminal as an individual who needs either punishment to pay a debt to society or rehabilitation to be safe to rejoin it. In the ancient world, however, the criminal represented not an individual who did wrong, but problem with the community. A sort of tear or wound in it, that had to be healed or cleansed. Which approach sounds better to you?\u201d\nHe pauses, although it doesn\u2019t seem like he has much expectation of a response from the diligent tappers. It\u2019s more of a rhythmic choice.\n\u201cIt might seem like that sense of collective responsibility is kinder, as if they\u2019re not really blaming the criminal. And in some senses that\u2019s true. At the same time, they don\u2019t really care about what happens to him. They might kill him or exile him, and it doesn\u2019t matter if he stole something because his family was starving, or killed someone who\u2019d harmed him. They weren\u2019t concerned with his reasons for doing it\u2014they just needed to get rid of the stain, in one way or another.\u201d\nSinger is only half-listening, since he\u2019s also out wandering the fertile imaginatory fields of present-day crime-solving. But he\u2019s present enough to be surprised at how much he\u2019s enjoying sitting here in a lecture hall, listening to a classics professor give a lecture. He wonders, idly, if he might have wasted his time in college. \nHe\u2019d fully inhabited his callow days\u2014no one had ever accused college-age Benny of being \u201cwise beyond his years\u201d or \u201can old soul\u201d or any other such pablum\u2014and his time at university was a hazy stretch of football games and beer and awkward dates and dehydration headaches. He\u2019d gone because it was what kids from good middle-class families did after high school, and because his parents took seriously the commandment that \u201call your children shall be learned.\u201d They couldn\u2019t ensure that he\u2019d actually absorb any learning, but they performed their responsibility to expose him to it admirably. \nHowever, Singer had grown into that rarest of specimens, especially in the machismo-scorched ranks of the police force: a man who had transformed, in the midst of an often brutish environment, into a sensitive, bookish soul. Now in what his British mother had always called a person\u2019s \u201cmiddage,\u201d he flatters himself that he\u2019s taken on a professorial air among his colleagues, though he\u2019s never had the courage to probe whether they\u2019d agree with that characterization. It makes him feel a sort of warm, self-congratulatory collegiality with Professor Green, a pleasant anticipation that when this lecture ends and he approaches the other gentlemen, they\u2019ll engage in a mutually admiring, elevated discourse of the sort he can\u2019t have with his actual coworkers.\nSinger actually is here to work, not just to enjoy a brief opportunity to experience what it might have been like not to waste his obligatory stint in academia. \nProfessor Green has been recommended to him as an expert who might help him solve an intriguing puzzle posed by evidence from his current case: a mutilated antique volume in Greek, found beside the body of the victim of a presumed homicide.\nThe victim was an antiquarian of some means\u2014his modest fortune seems almost quaint in these days of tech tycoons and biopharma billionaires, but it\u2019s still life-changing lucre for the average Joe. The deceased might have said, without irony, that he was comfortable, since these days one has to be wealthy to be comfortable. \nIt\u2019s d\u00e9class\u00e9, certainly, to delight in a murder. The antiquarian was a human being who had his life prematurely taken from him and, yes yes, deserved to live out the two or three years he had left at the age of 97 in peace, rather than dying violently. Violently, at least, in the sense that murder is inherently violent, since death was caused by a cocktail of sleeping pills and narcotic painkillers. Dying via the fun drugs at the wealthy (both materially and in years) age of 97 seems to Singer a rather ideal way to go, but he recognizes that he must pay homage to the idea that this is first a great tragedy and only secondly a delicious puzzle. \n\u201cCrime, to us, indicates not just a type of act but a type of person,\u201d Green is saying. He sneezes a little, for no apparent reason, since the dust motes sparkling plentifully in the shaft of sunlight laying a gentle hand upon his silver hair have remained consistent in quantity. \u201cWe define criminals as a separate category of people. We\u2019ve inherited this from what we call biological positivism, which wasn\u2019t called that in the Victorian era but certainly got its pop culture start there. They believed criminals were biologically different from normal people. You can see this assumption in play in the practice of phrenology, where they\u2019d measure the dimensions of someone\u2019s skull and the distance between their eyes to try to determine if they had criminal tendencies. Whether we like to admit it or not, some of that thinking is still with us in modern criminology, this idea that one has a biological predisposition toward crime, and the question of whether that predisposition is also predestination, whether someone with biological criminal tendencies can escape it. The ancient world didn\u2019t share this thinking about biology, but they were wrestling with similar questions about free will. For them, however, that predestination took the form of curses and destiny, often manifested in the figures of the Greek gods and other supernatural figures.\u201d\nSinger nods absently to that assertion, although he\u2019s only half-present. The death presents a pleasingly classic locked-room puzzle: the antiquarian\u2019s three children, their spouses, and their own children (and even, in one case, grandchildren), mostly from out of town, were all staying in his spacious home for the occasion of his 97th birthday. The elderly gentlemen had announced at dinner that he was changing his will. Some heated interchanges occurred, and he\u2019d gone to bed, locking his door. The following afternoon, when he hadn\u2019t emerged from his bedroom, his assistant insisted upon forcing her way in and found him dead. The autopsy revealed copious amounts of medications for which no on in the house, including the gentleman himself, had a prescription, and they appeared to have been administered via an injection in an anatomical region a person of his august years was unlikely to be able to reach on their own, and would have to have been done after he\u2019d gone to bed. The footage from the security camera in the hallway shows no one approaching the single door to the master suite. No one but the gentleman himself possessed a key to the chamber, and that key was located inside his nightstand.\nAn abundance of motive but a paucity of access present a colorful puzzle of the sort that most drearily modern and obvious homicides never even approach, but the locked room aspect isn\u2019t the end of the gifts this death has provided. As if to ensure that it was clear that death had come in the form of a second, human personage, there had been coins placed on the old man\u2019s eyes, and upon his chest rested the antique book that had brought Singer to this lecture hall, its cover slashed and most of its pages torn out. It was a distinctive-looking volume: brandy leather chased in gold, with a blood-red hand emblazoned across the front. \nSinger\u2019s enjoying the lecture\u2014ancient world crime-solving is, of course, conveniently relevant to his interests\u2014but he checks his watch. He could do with another cup of coffee if he\u2019s going to escape the somnolent spell of this classroom and be properly sharp for his discussion with the professor. He\u2019d made an appointment to see the gentleman, who\u2019d offered to meet him outside the building after his lecture, but Singer found himself curious about just what sort of academic he\u2019d been recommended, and decided to come early and attend the class. He\u2019s pleased with his expert, certainly, but he does want to get on with things. \n\u201cSo,\u201d Green says, \u201cwe\u2019re going to use the Oresteia as a window into classical Greek criminology. Orestes represents\u2014\u201d\nHe pauses.\n\u201cOrestes\u2014\u201d\nThe professor coughs. \nThe tapping of keys stills, the students waiting expectantly. \n\u201cOr\u2014\u201d\nGreen coughs harder, then begins clawing at his throat. His face turns an alarming scarlet hue, then darkens to purple. \nSinger is startled out of his reverie. He jumps to his feet. \u201cCall 911!\u201d he thunders at the frozen students. \u201cDo it now!\u201d He weaves his way out of the row, half-tripping over feet and the chairs\u2019 extended tablet-arms. \nThe students are beginning to process what\u2019s going on as white, blood-flecked froth foams up out of the professor\u2019s mouth. A few push themselves to their feet.\nThe bookish detective part of Singer\u2019s brain scoots out of the way to give the cop room. \u201cSit down!\u201d he shouts. \u201cThis is a police matter. No one leaves this room. Put your asses back in those chairs!\u201d\nSinger takes the wide, shallow stairs down the middle of the lecture hall two at a time, but as Green slumps over the podium, he already knows there\u2019s no way first responders are going to be able to help the professor. \nAs he gets close to the podium, a single detail seems to expand and fill his vision. \nOn the podium is an antique-looking tome, bound in cognac-colored leather and gilded, its cover blazoned with a scarlet hand. \nIt\u2019s the first indication Singer gets that this whole thing might be bigger than he thought.

    "text": "The salt air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, whipped Amelia\u2019s hair across her face as she wrestled with her oversized beach umbrella. Kennebunkport, Maine, in all its postcard-perfect glory, was living up to its reputation for blustery breezes. She finally managed to jam the umbrella\u2019s spike into the sand, securing it just as a particularly strong gust threatened to send it tumbling down the beach.\nAmelia sighed, brushing a stray strand of blonde hair from her eyes. This was supposed to be a relaxing vacation, a week of sun, sand, and solitude after a particularly brutal year in the New York advertising world. So far, the solitude was winning. She\u2019d arrived at her charming, albeit slightly creaky, rented cottage the previous afternoon, unpacked, and promptly fallen asleep. This morning, determined to embrace the coastal Maine experience, she\u2019d ventured out to Goose Rocks Beach, armed with a stack of paperbacks and a resolve to unwind.\nShe settled into her beach chair, adjusting her sunglasses and pulling her straw hat lower over her face. The rhythmic crash of the waves against the shore was soothing, and she finally began to feel the tension easing from her shoulders. She opened her book, a lighthearted romance about a baker who falls in love with a rugged firefighter, and lost herself in the story.\nA sudden shadow fell across her page. Amelia looked up, shielding her eyes from the sun. Standing before her was a man, tall and broad-shouldered, with sun-kissed skin and eyes the color of the deep ocean. He wore faded jeans, a worn navy blue sweatshirt, and rubber boots that looked like they\u2019d seen their fair share of ocean spray. He held a large, rectangular wooden trap in his hands. A lobsterman.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, his voice a low rumble that was almost drowned out by the crashing waves. \u201cI need to check my traps. I try to stay out of the way of the beachgoers, but this one\u2019s pretty close to shore.\u201d\nAmelia blinked, momentarily speechless. He was\u2026 breathtaking. Ruggedly handsome, with a weathered face that spoke of a life spent outdoors. She could practically smell the sea on him.\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d she stammered, scrambling to her feet. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see them.\u201d\nHe smiled, a flash of white teeth against his tanned skin. \u201cThey blend in pretty well with the rocks. Name\u2019s Ben.\u201d\n\u201cAmelia,\u201d she replied, shaking his outstretched hand. His grip was firm and calloused, sending a surprising jolt of electricity through her.\nBen turned his attention to the trap, carefully placing it on the sand. He knelt down, his movements fluid and practiced, and began to inspect it. Amelia watched him, fascinated. He worked with a quiet concentration, his brow furrowed in concentration.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Amelia said, trying to break the slightly awkward silence. \u201cYou\u2019re a lobsterman?\u201d\nBen glanced up, a grin playing on his lips. \u201cGuilty as charged. Been doing it since I was old enough to bait a trap.\u201d\n\u201cIt must be\u2026 interesting,\u201d Amelia said, searching for the right word. \u201cA challenging way to make a living.\u201d\n\u201cIt has its moments,\u201d Ben admitted. \u201cLong hours, tough weather. But there\u2019s nothing like being out on the water, watching the sun rise. And the lobsters aren\u2019t bad either.\u201d He winked.\nHe finished checking the trap and stood up, wiping his hands on his jeans. \u201cWell, I should get going. Don\u2019t want to keep my boat waiting.\u201d He gestured out towards the ocean, where a small lobster boat bobbed gently in the waves.\n\u201cIt was nice meeting you, Amelia,\u201d he said, his eyes meeting hers.\n\u201cYou too, Ben,\u201d she replied, feeling a blush creeping up her neck.\nHe turned and walked towards the water\u2019s edge, his boots sinking slightly into the wet sand. He waded out to the boat, climbed aboard with an easy grace, and started the engine. With a roar, the boat pulled away from the shore, heading out into the open ocean.\nAmelia watched him go, her heart beating a little faster than usual. She couldn\u2019t explain it, but there was something about Ben that had captivated her. Maybe it was his rugged charm, his connection to the sea, or simply the fact that he was the first person she\u2019d actually spoken to since arriving in Kennebunkport. Whatever it was, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that their paths were destined to cross again.\nShe returned to her beach chair, but her book no longer held her interest. She kept glancing out at the ocean, searching for Ben\u2019s boat. The image of his sun-kissed face and ocean-blue eyes was burned into her mind.\nThe rest of the afternoon passed in a blur. Amelia tried to relax, but her thoughts kept drifting back to Ben. She imagined him out on the water, hauling in traps, battling the waves. She wondered about his life, his family, what he did when he wasn\u2019t fishing for lobsters.\nAs the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Amelia decided to head back to her cottage. She packed up her things, feeling a sense of anticipation for what the next day might bring.\nBack at the cottage, Amelia took a long, hot shower, washing away the sand and salt from her skin. She changed into a pair of comfortable jeans and a light sweater, and decided to walk into town for dinner.\nThe town of Kennebunkport was bustling with activity. Tourists strolled along the streets, browsing the shops and admiring the charming architecture. The air was filled with the sounds of laughter, conversation, and the distant cry of seagulls.\nAmelia found a small, cozy restaurant overlooking the harbor and ordered a bowl of clam chowder and a glass of white wine. As she ate, she couldn\u2019t help but scan the faces of the other diners, half expecting to see Ben.\nHe wasn\u2019t there.\nDisappointment pricked at her, but she quickly brushed it aside. It was silly to think she\u2019d see him again so soon. Kennebunkport was a small town, but not that small.\nAfter dinner, Amelia strolled along the harbor, enjoying the cool evening air. The lights from the boats and the surrounding buildings reflected on the water, creating a magical scene. She stopped to watch a group of fishermen unloading their catch, the smell of fresh fish mingling with the salty air.\nAs she turned to leave, she saw him.\nBen.\nHe was standing near the edge of the dock, talking to another man. He was wearing a different sweatshirt, a dark green one, but Amelia recognized him instantly. Her heart skipped a beat.\nShe hesitated, unsure whether to approach him. What would she say? Would he even remember her?\nBefore she could decide, Ben turned and saw her. His eyes widened slightly, and a smile spread across his face.\n\u201cAmelia!\u201d he called out, waving to her.\nShe couldn\u2019t help but smile back. The feeling of anticipation that had been building inside her all day suddenly burst forth. This was it. Their paths were crossing again. And this time, she had a feeling it was more than just a chance encounter.",

    "text": "Sarah Chen stared at Congressman James Barrett's reflection in her laptop screen, and for a fraction of a second, his face wasn't his face at all.\nShe blinked, and the moment passed. Barrett continued pacing behind her desk, rehearsing his speech for tomorrow's House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. His cadence was perfect as always\u2014measured yet passionate, with just the right touch of gravitas. Every pause calculated for maximum impact.\n\u201cThe American people deserve to know,\u201d he declared, \u201cexactly how their tax dollars are being spent overseas. And more importantly, they deserve to know *why*.\u201d\nSarah's fingers flew across the keyboard, making minor adjustments to the speech text. After sixteen months as Barrett's senior legislative aide, she could anticipate his tweaks before he made them. A strengthened verb here, a shortened sentence there. Polish the rhetoric until it gleamed.\nBut she couldn't shake what she'd seen in that reflection. Or thought she'd seen. For just an instant, Barrett's familiar features\u2014the strong jaw, the distinguished salt-and-pepper hair that drove his Twitter followers wild, the penetrating blue eyes\u2014had seemed to... shift. Like a mask slipping, revealing something underneath. Something wrong.\n*Sleep deprivation*, she told herself. She'd been pulling fourteen-hour days all week, preparing for this hearing. The coffee maker in the office kitchen had become her closest friend, and her studio apartment in Columbia Heights was starting to feel like an expensive storage unit for her clothes.\n\u201cSarah?\u201d Barrett's voice pulled her back to the present. He'd stopped pacing and was looking at her expectantly. \u201cWhat do you think about adding a personal anecdote there? Something about my time in the Peace Corps?\u201d\n\u201cI...\u201d Sarah hesitated. The Peace Corps story was a good one\u2014Barrett had spent two years building schools in Nicaragua before law school. It played well with both progressives and moderates, humanizing him while emphasizing his commitment to smart, sustainable foreign aid. They'd used it dozens of times.\nBut for the first time, she found herself wondering: had anyone ever actually verified that story?\n\u201cSarah?\u201d Barrett prompted again. The overhead fluorescents caught his eyes at an odd angle, and for a moment they looked almost glassy, like marbles. Or camera lenses.\nShe suppressed a shiver. \u201cSorry, sir. Yes, I think the Peace Corps angle works well there. I can pull from your Guatemala speech last month\u2014the part about Maria and her daughter?\u201d\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Barrett flashed his trademark smile, the one that had launched a thousand campaign ads. \u201cWhat would I do without you?\u201d\n*Get a new handler*, whispered a treacherous voice in the back of her mind.\nSarah forced herself to smile back and pulled up the Guatemala speech file. As she copied the relevant section, a calendar notification popped up on her screen: \u201cCongressman Barrett - Quarterly Performance Review - 9:00 PM.\u201d\nShe frowned. \u201cSir? I don't have any performance review scheduled for\u2014\u201d\nThe words died in her throat as she turned around. Barrett was gone. The office door was closed, though she hadn't heard it open or shut. And taped to the inside of the door was a plain white envelope with her name typed on it.\nSarah glanced at her phone: 8:57 PM. The rest of the staff had left hours ago. In the sudden silence, she could hear the hum of the fluorescent lights, the soft whir of her laptop fan, and her own heartbeat, growing faster by the second.\n*This is crazy*, she thought. *I'm being paranoid. There's probably a perfectly reasonable explanation for...*\nBut she was already moving toward the door, her hand trembling slightly as she reached for the envelope. Inside was a single sheet of paper. The message was brief, typed in a plain font:\n\u201cDear Ms. Chen,\nYour suspicions are correct. The man you know as James Barrett is not what he appears to be. If you want to know the truth, come to the Lincoln Memorial at midnight. Come alone. Delete this message after reading.\nFor your own safety, tell no one what you've seen. They're watching.\nA Friend\u201d\nSarah read the message three times, her mind racing. This had to be a prank, right? Maybe Chelsea from Communications trying to freak her out, or that smug new intern who thought he was funny. But...\nShe thought about Barrett's reflection in her screen. The way his face had seemed to glitch, just for an instant. The oddly mechanical precision of his movements lately. The fact that she'd never once, in sixteen months, seen him eat or drink anything.\nA new notification popped up on her laptop: \u201cMeeting Location Changed - Cannon House Building Sub-basement Level B - 9:15 PM.\u201d\nShe'd worked in this building for nearly two years and had never heard of a Level B.\nSarah looked at the envelope in her shaking hands, then at her laptop screen, then at Barrett's empty office. Through the window, she could see the Capitol dome illuminated against the dark sky, majestic and immutable. The heart of American democracy.\n*What the hell am I involved in?*\nShe had two choices. She could delete the message, go home, and pretend this night never happened. Keep writing speeches, scheduling meetings, helping a man she'd admired become the next President of the United States. Keep her head down. Stay safe.\nOr she could start pulling on this thread and see what unraveled.\nSarah Chen took a deep breath, dropped the envelope into her paper shredder, and opened her laptop's calendar app. Her fingers moved swiftly across the keyboard as she created a new event for midnight at the Lincoln Memorial.\nThe fluorescent lights flickered once, and in the brief moment of darkness, she could have sworn she saw a red dot appear on her office wall\u2014like the recording light on a camera.\nOr a targeting laser.\nShe grabbed her coat and phone, leaving her laptop behind. As she hurried toward the elevator, she tried not to think about the fact that she'd never seen Barrett leave his office.\nOr about the sound now coming from behind his closed door, which might have been footsteps.\nOr might have been servos whirring to life.",

    "text": "The wind howled over the barren expanse, tugging at the edges of Dr. Elias Vinter\u2019s coat as he crouched in the muddy trench. Above him, the pale Northern sun struggled to pierce through the dense, slate-colored clouds, casting a muted light over the archaeological site. It was the third week of the dig, and morale among the team was waning. The promise of a long-forgotten settlement buried beneath the peatlands had yielded little more than fragments of pottery and weathered tools. Most of the students had retreated to the warmth of the base camp, leaving Elias alone to sift through the cold, unyielding earth.\nHe\u2019d almost missed it. The edge of his trowel had scraped against something hard, something that didn\u2019t match the brittle texture of bone or the coarse grain of stone tools. His heart quickened as he dug more carefully, brushing away the damp soil with trembling hands. Inch by inch, the object revealed itself: a small figurine, no more than six inches tall, carved from a dark, unidentifiable material that seemed to drink in the light rather than reflect it.\nElias held his breath as he lifted it free from its resting place. The figure was humanoid but distorted, its limbs elongated and bent at unnatural angles. The face was a grotesque mask of sharp angles and deep hollows, the mouth locked in a grimace that seemed to shift subtly when viewed from different angles. Runes\u2014archaic and unfamiliar\u2014were etched into its surface, spiraling in patterns that hurt his eyes if he stared too long.\nThe air around him felt suddenly heavier, pressing down on his shoulders like an invisible weight. A shiver ran through him, though the wind had stilled. He glanced over his shoulder, half-expecting to see someone standing at the edge of the trench, but he was alone. The site was silent save for the distant caw of a raven.\nElias knew he should call over one of his colleagues, document the discovery properly. But something held him back. A voice in the back of his mind\u2014quiet yet insistent\u2014urged him to keep it for himself. Just for now. Just until he could figure out what it was.\nSlipping the figurine into the deep pocket of his coat, he smoothed the earth over the hole and stood, brushing the dirt from his gloves. He felt the weight of the object against his side as he made his way back to the camp, a comforting yet disconcerting presence. The runes, the twisted form\u2014they gnawed at the edges of his thoughts, stirring questions he couldn\u2019t yet articulate.\n#\n---\n#\nThat night, in the dim solitude of his tent, Elias laid the figurine on his makeshift desk, a battered wooden crate piled with notes and sketches. He lit a lantern, its warm glow casting flickering shadows that seemed to dance and writhe across the canvas walls. The figurine seemed to absorb the light, its surface remaining stubbornly matte, as though rejecting the very notion of illumination.\nHe examined it more closely, running his fingers over the runes. The carvings were impossibly fine, far more intricate than anything he\u2019d seen in the region\u2019s typical artifacts. Yet there was a crudeness to the figure itself, a rawness that suggested it had been shaped by an unsteady hand\u2014or perhaps one guided by something other than skill.\nElias reached for his notebook, intending to sketch the figurine and jot down his observations, but as he stared at it, the words refused to come. His pencil hovered over the page, the blank expanse mocking him. The lines of the figurine blurred, twisted, as if the object were shifting under his gaze. He blinked hard and shook his head, breaking the spell.\nHe tried to tell himself it was nothing\u2014fatigue, the dim light, the isolation of the dig site playing tricks on his mind. But when he looked back at the figurine, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it was watching him.\n#\n---\n#\nIn the days that followed, Elias found himself drawn to the figurine with a compulsion that bordered on obsession. He kept it hidden, wrapped in a cloth and tucked away in his satchel during the day, always within reach. At night, he\u2019d sit for hours in his tent, studying its every detail. The runes seemed to shift when he wasn\u2019t looking, their patterns rearranging themselves into forms that defied logical interpretation. He began to dream of them, jagged symbols etched into his mind, pulsing with an otherworldly glow.\nThe dreams grew more vivid with each passing night. He saw himself wandering through an endless, fog-shrouded forest, the ground beneath his feet slick with black mud. The trees loomed tall and skeletal, their branches reaching like gnarled fingers toward a sky that churned with roiling shadows. In the distance, he could hear whispers\u2014a language he didn\u2019t understand but somehow knew was meant for him.\nWhen he woke, he felt drained, as though he\u2019d spent the night clawing his way through that endless mire. His colleagues began to notice the change in him. His once meticulous notes grew sparse and disorganized. His responses to their questions were clipped, his temper fraying at the edges. The site\u2019s lead archaeologist, Dr. Margit Lindholm, pulled him aside one afternoon, her brow furrowed with concern.\n\u201cElias, are you all right? You\u2019ve been\u2026 distant. Distracted. If something\u2019s wrong, you can talk to me.\u201d\nHe forced a smile that didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just tired. This dig\u2026 it\u2019s taking longer than I expected.\u201d\nMargit didn\u2019t look convinced, but she let it drop. \u201cWell, take care of yourself. We\u2019re all tired, but you look like you\u2019ve been carrying the weight of the world.\u201d\nElias nodded, his hand instinctively brushing against the pocket where the figurine rested. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Just need some rest.\u201d\nBut rest was the last thing he found. That night, the dreams took a darker turn. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, filling his mind with fragments of meaning he couldn\u2019t piece together. He saw the figurine in his dream, its runes glowing with a malevolent light, and felt an overwhelming urge to kneel before it. When he woke, he was on the floor of his tent, dirt smeared across his face and hands as though he\u2019d been clawing at the ground in his sleep.\n#\n---\n#\nBy the end of the week, the change in Elias was undeniable. His skin was pale and drawn, his eyes sunken and shadowed. He began avoiding his colleagues altogether, retreating to the trench where he\u2019d found the figurine and spending hours digging aimlessly, as though searching for something he couldn\u2019t name. The others whispered about him, their concern tinged with unease.\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the camp was bathed in the cool blue of twilight, Elias made a decision. He would leave the site. The figurine had become a burden he could no longer share, a secret too heavy to bear. But as he packed his belongings, he hesitated, the weight of the object in his hands anchoring him in place.\nThe runes glowed faintly in the dim light, pulsing like a heartbeat. He felt a strange clarity wash over him, a certainty that the figurine wasn\u2019t just an artifact. It was a key\u2014to what, he didn\u2019t know. But it called to him, and he couldn\u2019t ignore its pull.\nElias sat down on the edge of his cot, the figurine cradled in his hands. The air in the tent grew thick, the shadows deepening until they seemed to press against him. A faint hum filled the space, resonating in his chest, and he felt the world tilt beneath him. The whispers returned, clearer now, their words just on the edge of comprehension.\nAnd then, for the first time, the figurine moved.\nIt was subtle\u2014a shift, a slight bending of its twisted limbs. But it was enough to send a jolt of terror through Elias. He dropped it, stumbling back as it landed upright on the floor, its grotesque face turned toward him. The hum grew louder, the tent trembling as if caught in a storm. The whispers rose to a deafening roar, and Elias clapped his hands over his ears, his eyes locked on the figurine as it began to glow with an eerie, otherworldly light.\nThe last thing he saw before the darkness claimed him was the figurine\u2019s face, its grimace twisting into what he could only describe as a smile.",

    "text": "Charlotte Eastwick had always imagined her October would be filled with final wedding preparations and champagne toasts. Instead, she found herself walking along the rocky Maine coastline, trying to outpace memories of Devin that chased her like seagulls after scattered bread crumbs.\nThe breeze off the Atlantic carried the briny scent of seaweed and the distinctive tang of approaching autumn. Waves crashed against the weathered rocks below, sending up plumes of spray that caught the morning light. In Boston, the leaves would be turning brilliant shades of red and gold by now, but here in Kennebunkport, the coastal winds had already stripped many of the trees bare, leaving their branches to claw at the crystal-clear sky.\nCharlie adjusted her grip on her beach umbrella, canvas bag, and the paperback she'd grabbed from the local bookstore that morning. The woman behind the counter had smiled knowingly when Charlie purchased both the romance novel and a bar of chocolate. \u201cBad breakup?\u201d she'd asked. Charlie had only managed a weak smile in response. How could she explain that her perfect fianc\u00e9 had turned out to be running a side business in infidelity? Or that his family had written her a check with enough zeros to make her shame feel exponential?\nThe rocky path opened onto Cleaves Cove Beach, and Charlie felt her shoulders relax at the sight of the empty stretch of sand. Perfect. The last thing she wanted was to make awkward small talk with tourists asking why she was at the beach in October.\nShe picked her way across the sand, noting how different it felt from the manicured beaches she was used to. This was wild, untamed shoreline, with smooth stones mixed into the sand and tangles of seaweed marking the tide line. Charlie found a relatively flat spot and began setting up her umbrella, cursing under her breath as the wind caught it and nearly yanked it from her hands.\nAfter three attempts, she finally got the umbrella secured and spread out her towel underneath. The temperature hovered in the mid-sixties \u2013 warm enough in the sun, though the breeze held a bite that hinted at the winter to come. Charlie settled onto her towel and opened her book, determined to lose herself in someone else's romance rather than dwelling on the smoking ruins of her own.\nShe'd made it through exactly two paragraphs when a shadow fell across the page.\n\u201cHey there.\u201d The voice was deep, friendly, and carried just a hint of local accent. \u201cHate to interrupt your reading, but I should probably warn you \u2013 this stretch of beach is private property.\u201d\nCharlie tilted her head back, squinting against the sun. The man blocking her light was tall, broad-shouldered, and backlit like some kind of beachy demigod. As her eyes adjusted, she took in sun-bleached hair, tanned skin, and the kind of strong features that seemed carved by the same forces that had shaped the coastline.\n\u201cOh God, I'm so sorry.\u201d Charlie scrambled to her feet, almost taking out her umbrella in the process. \u201cI didn't see any signs.\u201d\n\u201cEasy there.\u201d He caught the umbrella before it could become an impromptu projectile. \u201cNo harm done. The owners just get pretty territorial about their slice of paradise. They've been known to call the police on unsuspecting tourists.\u201d His smile was warm, crinkling the corners of his eyes. \u201cI'm Finn, by the way. Finn Morgan.\u201d\n\u201cCharlie \u2013 well, Charlotte, but everyone calls me Charlie.\u201d She brushed sand from her legs, suddenly very aware that she was wearing an ancient pair of denim shorts she'd packed purely for comfort.\n\u201cTourist or local?\u201d Finn asked, though something in his tone suggested he already knew the answer.\n\u201cThat obvious, huh?\u201d Charlie managed a self-deprecating smile. \u201cI'm here for a week. Needed a change of scenery.\u201d\n\u201cFrom?\u201d\n\u201cBoston.\u201d She hesitated, then added, \u201cWhere I was supposed to be getting married next weekend.\u201d\nFinn's eyebrows rose slightly. \u201cSupposed to be?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Charlie focused on folding her towel, avoiding his gaze. \u201cTurns out my fianc\u00e9 believed monogamy was more of a suggestion than a requirement.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d The word carried genuine sympathy. \u201cThat's rough. I'm sorry.\u201d\nCharlie shrugged, aiming for casual and probably missing by a mile. \u201cIt is what it is. At least I found out before the wedding, right?\u201d\n\u201cStill.\u201d Finn studied her for a moment, then gestured down the beach. \u201cLook, if you're wanting somewhere quiet to read, I know a spot that's actually open to the public. Better view too.\u201d\nCharlie hesitated. On one hand, she'd come here specifically to avoid people. On the other, there was something about Finn that put her at ease \u2013 maybe it was the way he carried himself, comfortable in his own skin in a way Devin never had been, for all his designer suits and carefully cultivated image.\n\u201cYou're not going to lead me to some secluded spot and murder me, are you?\u201d The question slipped out before she could stop it.\nFinn laughed, the sound carrying over the crash of the waves. \u201cNah, murder's not really my thing. Too messy. Besides, I've got lobsters to catch later.\u201d He nodded toward a boat moored further down the coast. \u201cThat's my girl there \u2013 the *Mary Rose*.\u201d\n\u201cYou're a lobsterman?\u201d Charlie found herself falling into step beside him as they walked along the water's edge.\n\u201cBorn and raised. Family business.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cWhat about you? What do you do when you're not escaping wedding drama?\u201d\n\u201cGraphic design. Mostly corporate stuff, logos, branding.\u201d She didn't mention that she'd been about to launch her own firm, before everything imploded and Devin's family's hush money became too tempting to refuse. The NDA she'd signed felt like it was burning a hole in her back pocket, even though the actual document was locked in her desk drawer back home.\nThey rounded a bend in the coastline, and Charlie caught her breath. A small cove opened up before them, protected by rocky outcrops on either side. The water here was a deeper blue, and someone had arranged several large rocks into surprisingly comfortable-looking seats.\n\u201cThis is gorgeous,\u201d she said, meaning it.\n\u201cLocal secret.\u201d Finn grinned. \u201cWell, semi-secret. The tourists usually stick to the main beaches.\u201d He glanced up at the sky, which was still a brilliant, cloudless blue. \u201cJust keep an eye on the weather. Storms can come up fast around here, especially this time of year. You don't want to get caught out when the wind shifts.\u201d\nCharlie nodded, already imagining how perfect this spot would be for reading. Or thinking. Or just existing without the weight of everything pressing down on her.\n\u201cI should get back to the boat,\u201d Finn said. \u201cBut I'm sure I'll see you around. Small town and all that.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for the rescue.\u201d Charlie smiled, surprised to find it didn't feel forced. \u201cAnd the local intel.\u201d\n\u201cAnytime.\u201d He turned to go, then paused. \u201cOh, and Charlie? Your ex is an idiot.\u201d\nBefore she could respond, he was walking away, his long strides eating up the sand. Charlie watched him go, feeling something warm unfurl in her chest \u2013 something that felt dangerously like hope.\nWith a small shake of her head, she set up her umbrella again and settled in with her book. But her mind kept wandering from the pages to the way Finn's eyes had crinkled when he smiled, and how his voice had wrapped around her nickname like he'd been saying it for years.\n*Stop it*, she told herself firmly. She was here to heal, not to jump into another potential heartbreak. But as the waves crashed against the rocks and the October sun warmed her skin, Charlie found herself hoping she'd run into Finn Morgan again \u2013 preferably before the storms rolled in.",

    "text": "Sarah Chen\u2019s fingers hovered over the keyboard as Congressman James Barrett\u2019s voice filled the room. He paced the office like a caged tiger, the sharp clap of his shoes against the polished hardwood punctuating his words. The fluorescent lights overhead cast a stark glow on the walls adorned with framed photos of him shaking hands with farmers, veterans, and children\u2014the quintessential man of the people.\n\u201cThe American people,\u201d Barrett declared, emphasizing each syllable, \u201cdeserve to know how their tax dollars are being spent. Not tomorrow, not next year, but today.\u201d He paused, his piercing blue eyes locking onto Sarah. \u201cToo strong? Or does it hit the right note?\u201d\nSarah glanced at the speech on her laptop, the cursor blinking in sync with her quickening pulse. \u201cI think it\u2019s good,\u201d she said, her voice carefully measured. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 commanding.\u201d\nBarrett nodded thoughtfully and resumed pacing, the script in his hand rustling like dry leaves. He had a way of moving that demanded attention, every gesture deliberate, every turn calculated.\n\u201cCommanding,\u201d he repeated, testing the word. \u201cBut not too aggressive?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Sarah said, though she wasn\u2019t entirely sure. He always sought her input, dissecting the cadence and rhythm of each line, but his questions left her feeling like she was being tested. She supposed it was flattering\u2014a freshman aide whose opinion seemed to matter to a man on the brink of a presidential campaign. But it was also\u2026 odd.\n\u201cLet\u2019s tweak the second half,\u201d Barrett said, flipping through the pages. \u201cWhat if we reframe it? Something like, \u2018They have a right to demand transparency, because it\u2019s their money.\u2019 More personal. More immediate.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll make the change,\u201d Sarah said, typing quickly. The new line appeared on her screen, and she read it back to him.\nBarrett closed his eyes, mouthing the words as if tasting them. Then he opened them, sharp and bright. \u201cThat\u2019ll do. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d\nSarah adjusted her glasses and scrolled down. Her job was simple: refine, tweak, polish. And yet, every time they worked through a speech, she felt that nagging unease creep up her spine. Barrett\u2019s public persona was magnetic, his conviction palpable. But behind closed doors, he was\u2026 different. Not insincere, exactly, but detached, as though the fiery speeches were just lines in a play he\u2019d been cast in.\nBarrett stopped suddenly, mid-pace. \u201cSarah, what do you think about the word \u2018demand\u2019? Too harsh? Would \u2018expect\u2019 work better, or does that weaken it?\u201d\nShe hesitated, considering the nuance. \u201cI think \u2018demand\u2019 has more weight. It\u2019s stronger. \u2018Expect\u2019 feels a bit\u2026 passive.\u201d\nHe nodded, running a hand through his perfectly combed hair. \u201cGood point. Demand it is.\u201d He returned to the speech, but this time his voice softened, almost reflective. \u201cYou know, sometimes I wonder how much people really care about this stuff. Do you think they\u2019re paying attention?\u201d\nThe question caught her off guard. \u201cI think\u2026 I think they care when someone like you makes them care. You have a way of connecting with people.\u201d\nBarrett smiled, but it didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you to say.\u201d\nHer phone buzzed, jolting her out of her thoughts. She winced, fumbling to silence it. Barrett stopped mid-sentence, turning to her with an arched brow.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI should\u2019ve muted it.\u201d\nTo her surprise, he smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I needed a break anyway.\u201d He set the script down and stretched, rolling his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m going to grab some coffee. Take fifteen minutes. You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Sarah said, relieved. He disappeared through the door, leaving her alone in the quiet hum of the office. She picked up her phone and glanced at the screen. A text from an unknown number.\n*Your boss isn\u2019t who you think he is. If you want the truth, check under the bush near the Senate Fountain. Look for a plastic bag caught on it.*\nSarah stared at the message, her pulse quickening. A prank? Some kind of joke? She glanced at the door, half expecting Barrett to walk back in, smirking at her gullibility. But the text\u2026 there was something about it that felt off. Too deliberate. Too pointed.\nShe considered reporting it. That was the logical thing to do. But curiosity prickled at the edges of her mind, urging her to find out more. Before she could second-guess herself, she deleted the message, closed her laptop, and grabbed her coat.\nThe air outside was crisp, carrying the faint tang of exhaust and the murmur of distant traffic. The Senate Fountain loomed ahead, its water sparkling under the floodlights. Sarah\u2019s heels clicked against the pavement as she approached, her eyes scanning the bushes that lined the fountain.\nAnd then she saw it. A crumpled plastic bag, caught on the low branches of a bush. Her heart thudded as she crouched, glancing around to make sure no one was watching. The area seemed deserted, but her skin prickled with the sensation of being observed.\nHer fingers brushed against something hard and smooth beneath the bush. She pulled it free: a Ziploc bag, sealed tightly, with a thumb drive inside. Her breath caught as she turned it over in her hands. No markings, no note, just the drive.\nFor a moment, she hesitated. This was insane. She was an aide to one of the most prominent congressmen in the country, not some spy in a political thriller. But the weight of the drive in her hand felt undeniable, like a stone dropped into a still pond, sending ripples through her carefully ordered world.\nShe slipped it into her pocket and stood, brushing off her coat. As she walked back toward the Dirksen Building, her mind raced. Who had sent the text? What could be on the drive? And why her?\nWhen she reached Barrett\u2019s office, he was already back, coffee in hand, his expression as calm and collected as ever. \u201cReady to pick up where we left off?\u201d he asked, his tone warm, easy.\nSarah nodded, forcing a smile. But as she sat down and opened her laptop, the drive in her pocket felt like it was burning a hole through the fabric, heavy with secrets she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to uncover.",

    "text": "The wind, sharp and insistent, whipped across the exposed mountainside, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and distant pine. Dr. Elias Vinter hunched deeper into his worn Barbour jacket, the collar pulled high around his ears. He glanced at the bruised grey sky, a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach. The weather had been threatening for days, and the locals\u2019 warnings about sudden, violent storms in these northern Norwegian mountains echoed in his mind.\nElias straightened, pushing his worries aside. This dig, this remote Viking ship burial nestled high in the unforgiving landscape, was his focus. It had to be. His career had stalled, a dry spell of publications stretching into years. His lectures at the university had become rote, a weary repetition of well-worn material. And then there was Ingrid, his wife, the specter of divorce hanging heavy between them. This discovery, this excavation, was his chance to prove himself, to salvage something from the wreckage of his life.\nThe site itself was a hive of activity. A team of students, their faces flushed with exertion and the chill air, carefully brushed away layers of earth, revealing more of the long, elegant lines of the buried ship. Local workers, their faces weathered and wise, moved deftly amongst them, their knowledge of the terrain and the unpredictable weather invaluable. The rhythmic clang of trowels against stone, the low murmur of conversations in both Norwegian and English, and the ever-present sigh of the wind created a constant, almost hypnotic hum.\nElias\u2019s current task was meticulously documenting the area surrounding the ship's stern. He knelt on a small, portable stool, his fingers numb with cold despite his gloves. The fine, grey soil clung to everything, coating his hands, his clothes, even the lenses of his glasses. He squinted, carefully brushing away another layer of dirt from a section of what appeared to be a collapsed timber. The air was thick with the earthy smell of damp soil and the fainter, almost metallic tang of ancient iron.\nA sudden rumble echoed through the valley, deeper and more resonant than the usual gusts of wind. Elias looked up, his gaze drawn to the darkening clouds that swirled above the peaks. A flash of lightning illuminated the scene for a split second, followed by a low growl of thunder. The wind intensified, tugging at the tarpaulins that partially covered the dig site.\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re in for it,\u201d a voice boomed beside him. It was Bj\u00f8rn, one of the local workers, a man built like a bear with a booming laugh and eyes that seemed to read the weather like an open book. \u201cThe old gods are restless today.\u201d\nElias nodded, a shiver running down his spine that had nothing to do with the cold. He glanced at the other workers, who were beginning to move with a renewed urgency, securing the tarpaulins and gathering their tools.\nAs he turned back to his work, a faint glint of green caught his eye. It was nestled in the fine dust near where he had been working, almost invisible against the grey soil. Curiosity piqued, Elias leaned closer, carefully brushing away the remaining dirt. He thought at first it might be a shard of green glass or perhaps a small, weathered jewel.\nHe was so engrossed in his discovery that he almost didn\u2019t notice the first fat drops of rain that began to fall. The wind howled, and another, closer clap of thunder shook the ground beneath them.\n\u201cElias! We need to go!\u201d It was Dr. Astrid Olsen, his colleague and the lead archaeologist on the dig, her voice sharp with urgency. \u201cThe locals are saying this could turn nasty. We need to secure the site and get down to the village.\u201d\nElias glanced up, his eyes widening as he took in the scene. The sky had darkened dramatically, and the rain was coming down harder now, a steady drumming on the tarpaulins. The other workers were already scrambling towards the waiting Jeeps parked at the edge of the site.\n\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Elias called back, his voice barely audible above the wind and rain. \u201cI think I\u2019ve found something.\u201d He gestured to the small area he was working on, where the rain was now washing away more of the dirt, revealing more of the green object.\n\u201cElias, this is serious!\u201d Astrid shouted, her face etched with worry. \u201cThe locals say there\u2019s a risk of mudslides with this kind of rain. We have to leave now.\u201d\nHe knew she was right. He could see the urgency in the faces of the local workers, their eyes fixed on the darkening sky and the rapidly swelling streams that snaked down the mountainside. But something held him rooted to the spot. The glint of green had become more distinct, revealing the contours of what appeared to be a small figurine.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just mark this find,\u201d he said, his voice strained. \u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you. I\u2019ll follow in my Jeep.\u201d\nAstrid hesitated, her expression torn between concern and exasperation. Finally, with a sigh, she turned and hurried towards the waiting vehicles. \u201cDon\u2019t be long!\u201d she called back over her shoulder.\nElias watched them go, the red tail lights of the Jeeps disappearing down the winding mountain road. The rain was coming down in torrents now, soaking him to the bone. He barely noticed. His entire attention was focused on the figurine.\nAs the rain continued to wash away the soil, the figure became clearer. It was crudely carved, not of stone or metal, but of some dark, almost black material. It appeared to be a figure of a woman, though the details were worn and indistinct. The glint of green he had seen earlier was now revealed to be two small, cloudy green gems embedded in the figure\u2019s head, giving it an eerie, blind stare.\nElias felt a strange pull towards the figurine, an almost unsettling fascination. He began to carefully work it free from the earth, his fingers tracing the rough contours of its form. He found himself thinking of it as \u201cher,\u201d a strange, almost possessive thought.\nAs he gently loosened the figurine from the clinging soil, he discovered that she was mounted on the back of a small, muscular-looking warhorse. The details were crude, but the power of the animal was still evident.\nThe wind howled, and a sudden, ominous clattering sound made him jump. He looked up to see a nearby pile of stones beginning to slide down the mountainside, dislodged by the relentless rain. The ground beneath him was becoming saturated, the small streams around the dig site turning into rushing torrents.\nHe looked back down at the figurine, his jaw suddenly aching. He realized he had been holding a broad, almost manic grin for some time, without even realizing it. He wasn\u2019t sure how long he had been sitting there, in the pouring rain, grinning at nothing.\nWith a jolt, he snapped out of his trance. The storm was reaching a fever pitch. The rain was a blinding sheet, and the wind threatened to tear the remaining tarpaulins from their moorings. He had to get out of there.\nCarefully, almost reverently, he wrapped the figurine in a sopping wet towel that he had been using to clean his tools. He shoved it into his jacket pocket, the cold, damp object pressing against his chest.\nHe scrambled to his feet, his muscles stiff and aching. He waded through the mud towards his Jeep, the wind and rain buffeting him from all sides. As he fumbled with the keys, he knew one thing with absolute certainty. He wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone about this find. This was his, and his alone.",

    "text": "Commander Helena Vasquez felt the familiar weight of acceleration press her deeper into the command chair as the *Retribution's Blade* completed its final transition jump. The massive dreadnought's quantum displacement drive wound down with a subsonic hum that resonated through the ship's titanium-carbide hull, a sound that had become as comforting to her as a heartbeat over the past eighteen months.\n\u201cJump complete, ma'am,\u201d reported Lieutenant Chen from the navigation console, his neural interface crown flickering with data streams. \u201cWe're holding position at the Meridian system's heliopause, approximately forty-seven AU from the primary star.\u201d\nHelena's tactical display materialized in her peripheral vision, courtesy of her own military-grade neural implant. The Meridian system spread out before her in three-dimensional holographic detail\u2014a yellow dwarf star surrounded by eleven planets, three of which had been terraformed by the Hegemony Colonial Administration over the past century. More importantly, the system contained the largest concentration of quantum metallic hydrogen outside of Earth's home system, making it strategically invaluable to both the Terran Federation and their enemies in the Collective States.\n\u201cSensor sweep complete,\u201d announced Chief Warrant Officer Patel from the detection station. \u201cI'm reading approximately two hundred vessels in-system, ma'am. Breakdown as follows: fifty-seven civilian cargo haulers, thirty-four automated mining platforms, eighteen patrol craft...\u201d She paused, her expression darkening. \u201cAnd eighty-nine vessels of unknown configuration holding position in high orbit around Meridian Prime.\u201d\nHelena's jaw tightened. Eighty-nine ships was far more than intelligence had predicted. The Collective's Fifth Fleet was supposed to be scattered across three systems, not concentrated here in overwhelming force. Either their intelligence had been fatally flawed, or they'd walked into a trap.\n\u201cClassification on those unknowns?\u201d she asked, though she suspected she already knew the answer.\n\u201cAnalyzing now, Commander.\u201d Patel's fingers danced across her holographic interface, neural pathways processing terabytes of sensor data in milliseconds. \u201cConfirmed: Collective signatures. I'm reading twelve heavy cruisers, twenty-four destroyers, fifteen frigates, and... God's blood, ma'am. Thirty-eight dreadnoughts.\u201d\nThe bridge fell silent except for the ambient hum of life support systems and the distant thrum of the fusion reactors. Thirty-eight dreadnoughts represented enough firepower to glass a planet's surface or shatter an entire fleet. Helena's own task force consisted of just four dreadnoughts, eight heavy cruisers, and sixteen destroyers\u2014formidable by any standard, but woefully outgunned against what awaited them in Meridian space.\n\u201cTime to fleet rendezvous?\u201d Helena asked, her voice steady despite the cold calculation running through her enhanced cognitive processes.\n\u201cAdmiral Kowalski's Third Fleet is still fourteen hours out,\u201d replied Chen. \u201cThe Fourth Fleet won't arrive for another twenty-six hours.\u201d\nTwenty-six hours. The Collective fleet could reduce the orbital habitats and planetary settlements to radioactive debris long before reinforcements arrived. Helena's tactical subroutines ran probability analyses at superhuman speed, each simulation ending in catastrophic failure. Unless...\n\u201cMs. Patel, what's the configuration of their fleet positioning?\u201d\nThe sensor officer's brow furrowed as she processed the question. \u201cThey're maintaining a standard orbital defense grid, ma'am. Overlapping fields of fire, mutual support clusters, with the dreadnoughts forming the primary defensive perimeter.\u201d\n\u201cStandard doctrine,\u201d Helena murmured, more to herself than to her crew. The Collective military operated with rigid adherence to established tactical principles\u2014a strength in most situations, but potentially exploitable by an opponent willing to think outside conventional parameters.\nShe activated her command neural link, establishing encrypted communications with the other vessels in her task force. Captain Morrison of the *Sovereign's Wrath*, Captain Zhang aboard the *Democratic Fury*, and Captain Al-Rashid commanding the *People's Justice* appeared as ghostly holographic figures around her chair.\n\u201cSituation report, Commanders,\u201d Helena began without preamble. \u201cWe're facing a Collective fleet nearly twice our projected strength. Recommendations?\u201d\nCaptain Morrison, a grizzled veteran of the Titan War, shook his head grimly. \u201cMa'am, with respect, we should consider withdrawal. Even with our technological advantages, those odds are insurmountable in a direct engagement.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d added Captain Zhang. \u201cOur quantum torpedo loadout gives us superior firepower per vessel, but thirty-eight dreadnoughts is simply too much mass to overcome.\u201d\nCaptain Al-Rashid remained silent for a moment, his enhanced eyes processing tactical data at accelerated rates. \u201cThere might be another option,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThe Collective's positioning suggests they're preparing for a conventional fleet engagement\u2014they expect us to advance in standard formation and attempt to break their defensive perimeter.\u201d\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Helena prompted.\n\u201cWhat if we don't give them that fight? The asteroid field in the outer system provides excellent cover, and our stealth capabilities are superior to theirs. We could conduct a series of hit-and-run attacks, forcing them to disperse their formation.\u201d\nHelena's tactical implants were already running simulations based on Al-Rashid's suggestion. The probability matrices looked marginally better, though still heavily weighted against success. However, there was another factor to consider\u2014one that her fellow commanders couldn't access through their standard military hardware.\nDeep within Helena's consciousness, beyond the reach of conventional neural interfaces, lay her most closely guarded secret: a prototype artificial intelligence core, a gift from her former lover and current enemy, Dr. Marcus Chen of the Collective Research Division. The AI, which she'd named Athena, possessed computational capabilities that exceeded even military-grade quantum processors.\n*Analysis, Athena,* she thought.\n*Fleet engagement probability of success: twelve percent,* came the immediate response, transmitted directly to her consciousness through quantum-encrypted channels. *However, alternative tactical options available. Collective fleet positioning reveals vulnerability: their command structure relies on centralized coordination through the flagship \u201cInexorable Will.\u201d Decapitation strike could create sufficient chaos to allow successful engagement.*\nHelena's pulse quickened. A decapitation strike\u2014the targeted elimination of enemy command and control\u2014was theoretically possible with their stealth capabilities and quantum weaponry. But it would require precise timing and likely sacrifice at least one of her vessels to achieve.\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d she said aloud, \u201cI'm transmitting updated tactical parameters. We're going to attempt something unconventional.\u201d\nAs the holographic tactical display updated with her proposed battle plan, she watched her fellow commanders' expressions shift from skepticism to amazement to grim determination. The plan was audacious, bordering on suicidal, but it offered their only realistic chance of victory.\n\u201cCommander,\u201d Captain Morrison said slowly, \u201cthis requires one of our dreadnoughts to essentially commit suicide by ramming through their defensive perimeter. Which vessel are you proposing for that role?\u201d\nHelena's smile held no warmth. \u201cThe *Retribution's Blade* will have that honor, Captain. My ship has the most advanced stealth systems and quantum shielding. If anyone can punch through their defenses and reach the Collective flagship, it's us.\u201d\nThe next several hours passed in a blur of preparation. Quantum torpedoes were loaded and armed, stealth systems calibrated to maximum efficiency, and shield generators pushed beyond their normal operational parameters. Helena walked through her ship's corridors, speaking with crew members, ensuring that everyone understood both the mission's importance and its likely cost.\nAs she stood in the observation deck, watching the distant stars of Meridian space, Helena felt Athena's presence in her mind once more.\n*Second thoughts, Commander?*\n*None,* Helena replied without hesitation. *The Collective has killed too many civilians, enslaved too many worlds. If this is where we make our stand, then so be it.*\n*Your probability of survival is approximately fifteen percent.*\n*Then I'll have to be very lucky, won't I?*\nThe AI's equivalent of laughter rippled through her consciousness. *Indeed. Though I suspect luck will have little to do with what happens next.*\nHelena returned to the bridge as the ship's chronometer showed just two hours until the attack commenced. Her crew moved with the practiced efficiency of veterans, each person focused on their assigned tasks with the knowledge that failure meant not just their own deaths, but the deaths of millions of innocents on the planets below.\n\u201cAll stations report ready, Commander,\u201d announced her executive officer, Commander Sarah Okafor. \u201cStealth systems are operating at peak efficiency, and the quantum torpedo bays are fully loaded.\u201d\n\u201cVery good, XO.\u201d Helena settled into her command chair, feeling the neural interface establish its connections. Around her, the bridge hummed with barely contained energy\u2014both technological and human.\n\u201cOpen channel to the fleet,\u201d she ordered.\n\u201cChannel open, ma'am.\u201d\nHelena drew a deep breath, knowing that her next words would likely be among the last she ever spoke. \u201cThis is Commander Vasquez to all vessels. Today we face an enemy that believes overwhelming force guarantees victory. They're about to learn otherwise. Execute Operation Meridian Gambit on my mark. And remember\u2014we fight not for glory, but for the millions of souls counting on us to see another sunrise.\u201d\nShe closed the channel and activated the ship's internal communications. \u201cAll hands, this is the Captain. Prepare for combat operations. May fortune favor the bold.\u201d\nThe *Retribution's Blade* began its final approach toward the Collective fleet, her quantum drives running silent, her hull nearly invisible against the cosmic background. Behind her, the rest of Helena's task force moved into position, their own roles in the deadly ballet about to unfold.\nAs the distance closed and targeting solutions began to form, Helena felt a strange sense of peace settle over her. Whatever came next, she would face it with her eyes open and her conscience clear. The fate of the Meridian system\u2014and perhaps the entire war\u2014now rested in the hands of four ships and their crews, racing through the void toward a rendezvous with destiny.",

    "text": "The cool, thin air of a late autumn morning bit at Liam's cheeks as he hurried through the cobbled streets of Hearthwood. It was a crisp, clear day, the kind that promised frost by nightfall. The sun, a pale coin in the eastern sky, cast long, brittle shadows of the town's thatched rooftops and skeletal oak trees. The scent of woodsmoke, wet earth, and fresh-baked bread hung heavy in the air, a comforting and familiar perfume that had been the backdrop to all his twenty years of life.\nHearthwood was a town of no particular consequence, nestled in a wide, verdant valley at the very edge of the Kingdom of Aethelgard. It was far enough from the capital of Northward to be largely forgotten by the King's Court and close enough to the northern mountains to have a population of hardy, independent-minded people. For as long as anyone could remember, Hearthwood had been a quiet place of farmers, tradesmen, and simple folk, and Liam, the apprentice to the town's elderly Scholar, wouldn't have had it any other way.\nHis master, an old man named Elara, was both the town's loremaster and its healer, a rare combination that spoke to a quiet wisdom far older than the mountains that guarded the valley. Liam's work was a steady and unhurried rhythm of grinding herbs, transcribing ancient texts, and organizing the endless shelves of scrolls in Elara's library. It was a life of quiet purpose, one that had seemed destined to continue until the end of his days.\nThis morning, however, there was a new kind of urgency in his step. The weekly delivery of supplies from the capital was late. It was never late. In all his time as Elara's apprentice, the delivery carts had arrived at dawn on the third day of the week, without fail. He had gone to the town gates an hour ago and found only the empty, rutted tracks of the King's Road, disappearing into the mist-shrouded distance.\nHe arrived at Elara's cottage and pushed open the heavy oak door. A warm rush of air, smelling of chamomile and old parchment, greeted him. Elara was sitting at his large, cluttered table, a quill poised over a half-finished parchment. His white hair, thin and fine, seemed to catch the lamplight like a faint halo. He looked up, his pale blue eyes, as clear as a mountain stream, regarding Liam with a knowing calm.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t come, Master,\u201d Liam said, his breath still catching in his throat from the brisk walk.\nElara nodded slowly, a small, weary sigh escaping his lips. \u201cI had a feeling they would not.\u201d\nLiam frowned, pulling a stool up to the table. \u201cHow could you know?\u201d\nThe old man simply tapped the parchment with his quill. \u201cThe message I am writing, Liam. It is a report of all the strange things that have been happening this past month. The wild deer have vanished from the southern woods. The river fish swim in circles. The air has a\u2026 a different flavor to it.\u201d He paused, his gaze fixed on some far-off point beyond the walls of the cottage. \u201cThe balance is shifting, my boy. There are whispers on the wind.\u201d\n\u201cWhispers? What whispers?\u201d\n\u201cOf an army, they say. One that marches without banners, from the east.\u201d\nLiam felt a cold knot tighten in his stomach. The east. That was the Great Dividing Range, the impassable wall of peaks that separated Aethelgard from the uncharted lands beyond. Nothing came from the east. It was a place of myth and legend, home only to ancient spirits and the echoes of a forgotten time.\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible, Master. No one has ever crossed the Divide.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Elara said, his voice soft but firm. \u201cBut an army does not need to cross the Divide if it already waits on the other side. Do you remember the legends of the Rift?\u201d\nLiam\u2019s blood ran cold. The Rift. A tale Elara had told him countless times during long winter nights. It was said that many centuries ago, a tear in the very fabric of reality had opened between their world and another. A war had been fought to close it, a war so terrible it was only spoken of in hushed tones. The last of the wizards had sacrificed themselves to seal the tear, and a great silence had fallen over the land.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just a story, Master. A cautionary tale for children.\u201d\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Elara\u2019s eyes held a deep sadness. \u201cThe King\u2019s Court would scoff at the thought, but the land itself knows. The animals know. And the trees know, if you listen closely enough.\u201d He pushed the quill and inkwell toward Liam. \u201cI need you to take this message to Northward. The King\u2019s Council must be made aware. Something is coming, Liam. I feel it in my bones. It\u2019s a great darkness, and it begins with a great silence.\u201d\nA sense of dread, cold and unfamiliar, settled over Liam. He had never been beyond Hearthwood. The King\u2019s Road stretched out for ten days of hard travel to the capital. The journey was long and perilous even in the best of times, with bandits and wild beasts to contend with. But he saw the fear in his master's eyes, a fear he had never seen before.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave at once, Master.\u201d\nElara placed a gentle, bony hand on Liam\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGood. Be swift, but be careful. Do not draw attention to yourself. The road is not as empty as it seems.\u201d He then reached under his table and pulled out a small, well-worn satchel. \u201cTake this. It has enough food and water for the first few days, and a small purse of coins for your journey. There are also a few extra scrolls\u2014just in case you encounter someone who can provide you with information.\u201d\nLiam took the satchel, his fingers brushing against a hard object within. He opened it and saw a worn leather-bound book, its pages yellowed with age. \u201cThe Book of Lore?\u201d he whispered. This was Elara\u2019s most prized possession, a compendium of forgotten spells, ancient history, and healing secrets.\n\u201cI want you to have it,\u201d Elara said, a faint smile gracing his lips. \u201cIt has been my companion for many years, and I believe it is time for it to find a new home. You have a good heart, Liam, and a thirst for knowledge. You will be a great Scholar someday.\u201d\nAs Liam stepped out of the cottage, the world seemed to have changed. The town that had always felt so secure now felt fragile. The familiar scents of woodsmoke and fresh bread now seemed tinged with the scent of fear. The sun, once a comforting coin in the sky, now seemed to offer no warmth at all. He had always been a simple apprentice, a boy who thought his biggest concern would be remembering the names of obscure medicinal herbs. Now, he carried a book of secrets and a dire warning for a king he had only heard of in stories. He was on the brink of an adventure he had never asked for, on a road that would take him far from the only home he had ever known.\nHe looked back at the town one last time, at the spire of the temple and the smoke rising from a hundred chimneys. It was a world of peaceful ordinariness, one he had always taken for granted. He wondered if he would ever see it again, or if the whispers on the wind were the last breath of the world he knew. He took a deep breath, fastened his satchel, and turned onto the King\u2019s Road, his young heart pounding with a mixture of fear and a strange, exhilarating sense of destiny.",

    "text": "The air smells like ash.\nIt\u2019s in my lungs every time I take a breath, hanging thick and bitter like the taste of burnt metal. The city, once a gleaming monument to human ambition, is now a crumbling relic. What was once a proud skyline is nothing more than a jagged outline against a sky gone permanently gray. The towers that used to pierce the clouds are now hollowed-out shells, their windows shattered like broken teeth. The streets, once alive with the hustle of thousands, are now silent\u2014except for the occasional creak of metal or the distant clatter of fallen debris.\nI pause at the edge of the bridge, where the dark river below churns with the weight of a thousand forgotten secrets. The water used to sparkle, or so they say. Now, it\u2019s a slow-moving sludge, carrying the weight of everything that\u2019s gone wrong.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at that river for too long,\u201d Kiera says, her voice cutting through the quiet like a blade. She steps up beside me, her boots making no sound on the cracked concrete. I don\u2019t have to turn to know she\u2019s there. I can feel her presence in the tension between us. She\u2019s always been good at that.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d I murmur, running my fingers along the jagged edge of the bridge\u2019s rusted rail. The thought of the past feels almost surreal now\u2014like some distant memory I can\u2019t quite reach. The world that used to be is fading, replaced by something darker, something I never asked for.\nShe smirks, but there\u2019s no humor in it. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it. You\u2019ll make your brain rot faster than the air out here.\u201d\nI give her a half-smile, though it doesn\u2019t reach my eyes. Kiera\u2019s always been blunt. It\u2019s part of what keeps us alive, I guess. The bluntness, the hard edges, the refusal to feel too much. Feeling too much gets people killed.\nWe stand there for a while, the city\u2019s broken silence pressing down on us. It\u2019s hard to remember what it was like before the Collapse\u2014before the world burned itself to the ground in a haze of greed and apathy. But there are moments, fleeting as they are, when I almost do.\n\u201cDo you ever wonder if it was worth it?\u201d I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.\nKiera stiffens beside me, the air around her suddenly thick with tension. \u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d she says quickly, like the words have been rehearsed too many times. \u201cBut we can\u2019t waste time thinking about that now. We\u2019ve got enough problems as it is.\u201d Her gaze flicks toward the distant horizon, where the towering smoke from the factories marks the edge of our world.\n\u201cRight.\u201d\nI swallow the lump that rises in my throat, trying not to think about the weight of what we\u2019ve lost. I can feel it in the pit of my stomach, that ache of knowing we\u2019ll never go back to what we were. The world as it was is gone, and with it, so much of what made me\u2026 me.\nA loud crack sounds in the distance, followed by the unmistakable thrum of engines. Kiera doesn\u2019t even flinch, but I can feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up. It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve heard that sound, but every time, it sends a cold shiver through my bones. The Patrol is out there. And when they\u2019re out there, it means trouble.\n\u201cWe should go,\u201d I say, already turning toward the shadowed alley that runs parallel to the bridge.\nKiera hesitates for just a moment, and I glance back. Her gaze is locked on the horizon, her face unreadable. I know she\u2019s thinking about the same thing I am: The Patrol doesn\u2019t just wander aimlessly. They\u2019re looking for something\u2014or someone.\nShe catches my eye and nods sharply. \u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201d\nWe slip into the shadows, blending into the wreckage of a city that used to have a name, a life, a future. But now it\u2019s all just ruins. The only future left is the one we\u2019re making for ourselves, step by dangerous step.\nI don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll last, but I do know this: The moment you stop running is the moment you\u2019re as good as dead. And no matter how much I wish otherwise, I\u2019m not ready to die.\nNot today.\nNot yet.",

    "text": "Look at this foolish woman, charging through a blizzard in the dead of night, her horse floundering through chest-high snowdrifts as she rides like the devil himself is at her heels. Two women, actually\u2014her maid Cecelia is too brave and loyal for her own good.\nThough I say \u201cwoman,\u201d in that moment she might as well have been a girl. We're always youngest in our most desperate moments, aren't we?\nThat's me, or rather it was me, a lifetime ago. Racing to save the man I loved.\nOn Christmas Eve, of all nights.\nBut forget my foolishness for a moment. Let's spare a thought for that poor horse. His name was Jonquil, and he deserved none of this. He hadn't married a man who tumbled from disaster to disaster, nor had he decided he couldn't bear to be a widow and taken matters into his own hands. He could have bucked me into a snowbank and trotted off to the nearest village, where some peasant would have welcomed him as a mysterious Christmas gift. Instead, he fought his way through those drifts, probably whinnying *Winnie, what manner of madness have you dragged us into this time?* under his breath.\nOh, come now, I hear you thinking, how perilous could a snowy ride truly be? Well, before you grow too skeptical of my predicament, remember that in my day, you could die from a paper cut. Everything was trying to kill us. Modern folk hear about our average lifespans and assume that in my era, you were ancient at thirty. That's not how averages work, dear reader. You were still in the bloom of adulthood at thirty, and we had our share of septuagenarians and octogenarians, even a handful who reached their nineties. We didn't age faster than you do\u2014we simply died younger. If plague or wounds or brigands didn't claim us, politics stood ready on the scaffold with a bloody axe in hand.\nDon't fret\u2014she'll reach London safely, though it was madness to attempt a month-long, three-hundred-and-fifty-mile journey through the brutal Scottish winter. At least this fool was hardy, even if the ordeal took its toll on her health. She'll make it to the court of George I, that Protestant pretender, where she'll plead for her husband's life while the king ignores her. She won't surrender when she's dragged across the tiles of his courtroom, clinging to his robes, any more than she gave up in the snow and dark and biting wind.\n\u201cNever trust a Scot,\u201d Catherine Walpole sneered while her monarch tried to slink away, with me clinging to his sleeve like a determined burr. \u201cShe's probably got a dagger hidden up there.\u201d\nUp your sleeve is where you hide tricks, not dirks, you silly English bint. Not that you'd know, with not a thought in your outrageously bewigged head beyond fripperies and jewels and your next liaison. What could you know of desperation? My knife was at my belt, naturally, though I had no real hope of using it. I was already contemplating, since this approach wasn't bearing fruit, what other items one might conceal in one's clothing. *Vestis virum facit*, after all.\nPerhaps she was wiser than I gave her credit for, with her obsession over dresses. Used properly, a good gown can accomplish what an army cannot.\nWas he worth all this effort, you're wondering, before you've heard even half the tale?\nI've been called calculating, but the mathematics of love exceed my skills. I honestly couldn't say. He brought me almost all my misery, and I wouldn't change a moment of it.\nWe were young when we met\u2014well, not by the standards of our time. I was nineteen, which was hardly young to be married, though I'm not convinced that made my judgment any sounder.\nIf you're curious what won me over, well, a proper Catholic girl doesn't kiss and tell, but mercy me: that *kiss*.\nWe were at the French court, and I was quite the charmer, so I had plenty of points of comparison\u2014though I'll leave those liaisons dangereuses to your imagination. I was discreet, naturally, being neither fool nor flirt.\nWe kissed, I fell under his spell, and the rest\u2014the parts that matter far less than you'd think\u2014lies scattered through the history books. Reader, I married him.\nHis name was William. William and Winifred. Willy and Winnie\u2014perfectly darling, isn't it? Or Will and Win, which paints us as quite the power couple. Never mind that his perpetual weakness of will landed us in one scrape after another, leaving me to manufacture victories where I could. Yet whenever I tried to be firm with him, he'd turn those sweet eyes on me, and I'd see again the boy I'd kissed in the French court, and my good sense would desert me entirely.\nDepending on your perspective, I was either doomed by my family history to the sort of trouble he brought me, or I'd witnessed enough of it firsthand that I should have known better.\nMy father spent six bitter years in the Tower of London, caught in the anti-Catholic hysteria of his day. They believed he'd plotted to overthrow the British throne. According to the gossips, my mother hatched some ill-conceived scheme to free him and got herself arrested in the bargain, though they were both eventually released.\nThe truth? My mother's only crime was an excess of kindness. She gave money to Catholic prisoners, sending it through her midwife. But the midwife got entangled with a man called Thomas Dangerfield, who lost his heart (metaphorically) to my mother's almoner. When his affections weren't returned, he fabricated an entire Catholic conspiracy against the English throne just to implicate her. My mother nearly lost her head (literally) before the truth came to light.\nLet that be a lesson: never trust a man with \u201cdanger\u201d in his name.\nChildren should strive to surpass their parents' failures, so instead of being an innocent freed from the Tower after being falsely accused of participating in a fake Catholic plot against the King of England, Willie and I participated in a real Catholic uprising against the king of England, attempting to install a Scottish Catholic king in his place. Not to brag, but we got away Scot-free.\nMy parents weren't the only poor role models in matters of sense and survival. The year after my marriage, my older brother languished in Ghent, too ill to travel after being implicated in\u2014you'll never guess\u2014a Catholic plot to overthrow the British throne. You might recognize Ghent\u2014it's where John of Gaunt hailed from, one of the men who started this whole king-switching business. From my current lofty perspective of being dead, I can tell you that in retrospect, we probably should have simply weathered the snowballing disaster that was Richard II rather than replacing him, given the avalanche of troubles that well-intentioned endeavor ultimately caused. But hindsight is ever eagle-eyed, isn't it?\nSpeaking of snowballs...\nLet's return to that woman on her horse, in the endless darkness and cold and whirling snow, on Christmas Eve.\nWe'll get to all the history that brought her there, and everything that followed, but she was still close enough to home that she could have turned back and let Providence handle events. That was the moment, her heart quailing as the cold and hunger truly took hold and poor faithful Jonquil stumbled in the snow as though he might not reach shelter before winter claimed them all, that she decided what mattered most.\nI apologize. I've just realized I haven't properly introduced her. Me. Being dead does tend to muddle both your sense of time and your manners.\nMy name is Lady Winifred Maxwell, n\u00e9e Herbert, Countess of Nithsdale.\nI'm best known for breaking my husband, William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale, out of the Tower of London, but there's far more to me than that.\nAnd beneath it all\u2014the sartorial shell-games and popish plots, the midnight rides and French intrigues and long years in exile\u2014this is, at its heart, a love story.",

    "text": "It was a sunny Thursday morning in April, and Detective Benjamin Singer was attending a lecture for the first time in decades, daydreaming about murder.\nTo be fair, the setting practically begged for wandering thoughts. The lecture hall resided in a faux-medieval edifice with a mournful, ecclesiastical air, clearly built in an era when architecture aspired to elevate the mind. Cloudy, gothic-arched windows framed by wisteria vines gave the illusion of flouncy green-and-purple curtains, their distortion from age adding an ethereal touch. Inside, ancient radiators wheezed like asthmatic giants, producing a soothing white noise that blended with the faint rhythm of tapping laptop keys. The air carried the warm, dusty scent of sun-heated stone and paper\u2014a distinct aroma of old academia.\nIt was the perfect environment for a daydream, a meditation, or even a nap\u2014not for lack of interest but because it was so serene.\n\u201cIn the premodern world,\u201d Professor Green intoned, \u201cjustice wasn\u2019t about rehabilitation. That\u2019s a modern notion, rooted in Western individualism. Back then, the criminal wasn\u2019t seen as an individual to be corrected but as a problem with the community. A wound to be cleansed. Which approach sounds better to you?\u201d\nGreen paused, his question more rhetorical than probing. The students continued tapping, their focus trained on their screens.\n\u201cIt might seem kinder,\u201d he continued, \u201cthis sense of collective responsibility, as though they weren\u2019t blaming the criminal. But in truth, they didn\u2019t care about the criminal as a person. The reasons behind the act\u2014starvation, revenge, desperation\u2014meant nothing. They simply wanted to erase the stain.\u201d\nSinger, half-listening, let the words weave through his thoughts. He was surprised by how much he was enjoying the lecture\u2014by how comfortable he felt sitting in this cathedral of learning. A small part of him wondered if he\u2019d wasted his time in college.\nIn his youth, no one had accused Benny Singer of being \u201cwise beyond his years\u201d or an \u201cold soul.\u201d College for him had been a blur of football games, beer, awkward dates, and dehydration headaches. He\u2019d gone because it was what middle-class kids did, and because his parents, devout in their belief in education, insisted on it. They couldn\u2019t ensure he\u2019d absorb any learning, but they\u2019d fulfilled their part by sending him.\nNow, though, he\u2019d grown into an anomaly\u2014a man who, amid the machismo of the police force, had transformed into a sensitive, bookish soul. In his British mother\u2019s term, he\u2019d reached \u201cmiddage,\u201d a stage where he fancied himself as having a professorial air. He wasn\u2019t bold enough to ask his colleagues if they\u2019d agree, but the thought warmed him nonetheless.\nToday, however, he wasn\u2019t here for nostalgia. He was here to work. Professor Green, an expert on ancient justice, had been recommended to help him decode a peculiar piece of evidence in his latest case: a mutilated antique volume in Greek found beside a murder victim.\nThe victim, an antiquarian of considerable means, might have called himself \u201ccomfortable,\u201d though these days that level of wealth seemed modest compared to the riches of tech tycoons. He\u2019d died on the eve of his 97th birthday, surrounded by family members who were ostensibly there to celebrate\u2014but Singer suspected, mostly to squabble over his estate.\nThe death was an intriguing locked-room puzzle. After announcing during dinner that he planned to change his will, the elderly man had retired to his bedroom and locked the door. By the next afternoon, when he hadn\u2019t emerged, his assistant forced her way in and found him dead.\nThe autopsy revealed a lethal cocktail of unprescribed sleeping pills and narcotics, administered via injection in a spot the frail old man couldn\u2019t have reached on his own. Security footage showed no one approaching the door, and the only key to the room was found in the victim\u2019s nightstand. It was as though murder had walked through walls.\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the most curious detail. Someone had placed coins over the man\u2019s eyes and rested a mutilated antique book on his chest\u2014a cognac-colored leather volume with a blood-red hand emblazoned on the cover. The book\u2019s pages had been savagely torn, its significance yet unknown.\nSinger glanced at his watch. The lecture was fascinating, but he needed another cup of coffee before his meeting with Green. He\u2019d come early out of curiosity and wasn\u2019t disappointed\u2014Green had a commanding presence and a sharp mind.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Green was saying, \u201cwe\u2019re going to use the Oresteia as a window into classical Greek criminology. Orestes represents\u2014\u201d\nHe faltered.\n\u201cOrestes\u2014\u201d\nThe professor coughed, a small sound at first, then violent. His face flushed crimson before darkening to purple.\nSinger jolted to attention.\n\u201cCall 911!\u201d he barked at the frozen students, shoving past chairs and tablet arms as he made his way to the front.\nGreen clawed at his throat, frothy, blood-flecked foam spilling from his mouth. The students, stunned, began to rise.\n\u201cSit down!\u201d Singer bellowed. \u201cThis is a police matter. Stay in your seats!\u201d\nAs he reached the podium, dread settled in his gut. Green slumped forward, lifeless. The professor was beyond saving.\nBut it wasn\u2019t Green\u2019s collapse that froze Singer in place. It was the object on the podium: another antique book, bound in cognac leather and stamped with a blood-red hand.\nSinger\u2019s pulse quickened.\nThis wasn\u2019t just a puzzle anymore. It was a pattern\u2014and the stakes had just skyrocketed.",

    "text": "This shouldn\u2019t be possible. Gunnery Sergeant Karim Poole stared at the small figure huddled in the corner. A stowaway. On a warship in deep space.\nThe girl stared back, lower lip trembling, a dark curl plastered to a tear-streaked cheek. \u201cHave you seen my mommy?\u201d Her voice was a small, frightened whisper. She pressed herself against the junction of the corridor\u2019s glossy white rib and matte wall, ready to bolt.\nDamn it. Why me? Poole was terrible with kids. He forced a reassuring tone he didn\u2019t feel. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her.\u201d It sounded hollow, even to his own ears. What in God\u2019s name are you doing here?\nHow had a child breached the ship\u2019s security? Even if she\u2019d slipped past the base\u2019s docking procedures\u2014unlikely, given the stringent protocols\u2014they\u2019d been underway for months. How had she remained hidden for so long?\nWhat has she been eating? The question nagged at him, absurdly insistent.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sweetie?\u201d The words felt clumsy in his mouth.\n\u201cKel,\u201d she whispered, her voice barely audible.\nOh, hell. Please don\u2019t cry. \u201cThat\u2019s a great name,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cMy best friend\u2019s name is Kel.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a common name. Maybe this could be a connection. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go find her? She can help us find your mom.\u201d\nShe sniffled, wiping her nose with the back of her hand.\nHis Kel\u2014Staff Sergeant Kel Danvers\u2014was good with people. He\u2019d seen her calm down tense situations with a few quiet words. He couldn't imagine her being anything but gentle with a child. He, on the other hand\u2026\nThe little girl chewed a nail, her gaze fixed on him.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he urged, turning toward the crew quarters. Neither of them was on duty. His wristlet showed Kel in the lounge. He glanced back to ensure the girl was following.\nThe passageway was empty.\n\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d He bit back the curse. There was nowhere for her to go. The corridor curved gently, but a child couldn\u2019t have vanished that quickly. He\u2019d only looked away for a few seconds. Every door required a biometric scan, and hers wouldn\u2019t be in the system.\nThe hum of the ship, usually a background drone, seemed to amplify, pressing against his eardrums.\nThe structural ribs lining the corridor weren\u2019t wide enough to hide a child. Still, he checked behind each one, his unease growing.\nAs he reached a crossway, he heard crying. How\u2026\nHe turned the corner and stopped dead.\nIt wasn\u2019t the little girl.\nIt was Kel.\n\u201cKel?\u201d he whispered, his voice barely a breath.\nShe stood with her back to him, arms braced against the bulkhead, her body shaking with sobs. Her dark curls were damp, as if she\u2019d just emerged from a shower.\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cKel?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t react.\nHe took a hesitant step closer. Kel didn\u2019t break down in public. Something was terribly wrong.\nShe finally turned, her face flushed and blotchy, eyes red and swollen. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare walk away from me,\u201d she snarled, her voice thick with emotion.\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he stammered. \u201cKel, what\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m right here.\u201d\nShe bared her teeth, a raw, animalistic expression on her face. \u201cIf you leave now, don\u2019t even think about coming back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He felt a chill creep up his spine. \u201cKel, take a breath. Tell me what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\u201cI mean it.\u201d\nHe was no longer sure she was seeing him. Her gaze seemed to pierce through him, focusing on something beyond.\nHe turned.\nThe passageway behind him was empty.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026?\u201d He turned back to Kel.\nThe crossway was empty.\nWhat the absolute fucking hell?\nThe ship\u2019s hum vibrated through him, a low, unsettling thrum.\nHe found himself on the deserted storage deck. He\u2019d come for board games, a distraction, but now the idea felt pointless. I need to be around people.\nHe headed for the lift. And Medical.\nThen he heard it: the faint sound of crying.\nNo. It\u2019s a trick. There\u2019s no girl. And if that was Kel\u2026 she needs help.\nThe crying intensified, a thin, desperate wail.\nDamn it. He stopped, his hand hovering over his sidearm. No. Medical. Now. Almost against his will, he turned.\nAn elderly woman lay on the deck, her breathing shallow, her movements feeble.\nThis can\u2019t be real.\n\u201cHello?\u201d he called out, his voice strained. \u201cMa\u2019am, do you need help?\u201d\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d she gasped, her voice raspy. \u201cPlease\u2026 someone\u2026\u201d\nHe took a step closer, drawn by an unseen force. \u201cI\u2019ll get you help. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\nShe clutched her side, a pained groan escaping her lips. \u201cMy name\u2026 is Kel Danvers. Please\u2026 help me\u2026\u201d\nThe blood drained from his face. His skin felt clammy, cold. This is impossible.\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d she begged, her eyes pleading.\nNo. This is insane. He turned and ran, his boots pounding on the metal deck. He didn\u2019t stop until he reached the lift, pacing frantically until the doors opened, then sprinting toward Medical.\nHe collided with Private First-Class Andre Ortega.\n\u201cChrist!\u201d Ortega exclaimed, then flushed crimson. \u201cSorry, sir!\u201d\n\u201cMy fault,\u201d Karim managed, his breath ragged.\n\u201cDid you hear about what they found? That\u2019s why we changed course. We\u2019re orbiting it now.\u201d\nJust get out of my way. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, his voice flat.\n\u201cThe\u2026 I don\u2019t know what it is, sir. I was on the bridge taking lunch orders when they spotted it. On the main viewscreen. We\u2019re not close enough to see it with the naked eye yet.\u201d\n\u201cOrtega,\u201d Karim snapped, his patience frayed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 gold, sir. Like a honeycomb. Geometric. Huge. Way bigger than the ship.\u201d\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d He mumbled, \u201cLook, Ortega, I\u2019m not feeling well. I need to get to Medical. I\u2019ll hear about it later.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, sir. I hope you feel better.\u201d Ortega stepped aside, a nervous smile plastered on his face.\nKarim brushed past him, ignoring the curious glances of other crew members.\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, Poole?\u201d the doctor asked. He was younger than Karim preferred, but his brusque manner instilled a sense of confidence.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m hallucinating, Doc. Down in storage\u2026 I saw people who couldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re off-duty,\u201d the doctor noted. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d\nKarim shook his head.\nThe doctor\u2019s dark eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t panic, Poole. The stresses of deep space can play tricks on the mind, especially after months out here. You wouldn\u2019t be the first. Rest and some sleep aids should do the trick. We\u2019ll run a full scan, but I suspect that\u2019s all it is.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Doc.\u201d He let out a shaky breath. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStay off the storage deck for a while,\u201d the doctor said, a faint smile playing on his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s creepy down there even under normal circumstances. Stick to the well-lit areas until you\u2019re feeling better. Doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\u201cAye-aye, sir.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Let\u2019s get that scan started.\u201d The doctor turned to his console, pressing the call button. \u201cWe\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d\nA red alert light flashed above the door, and a klaxon blared through the medical bay.\nA soft knock at the door.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d the doctor called.\nA nurse poked his head in. \u201cDoc, we\u2019ve got a critical injury. External maintenance. Staff Sergeant Danvers. Her leg\u2019s caught in a hinge. Comms are down. She\u2019s been out there for a while. Suit\u2019s intact, but she\u2019s unconscious.\u201d\nThe doctor\u2019s face paled. He moved with sudden urgency. \u201cSurgery pod?\u201d\n\u201cPrepped and ready.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He turned back to Karim. \u201cPoole, I\u2019m putting you on medical leave for two weeks. Come back tomorrow for that scan.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Karim\u2019s voice was barely a whisper. He felt a cold dread settle in his stomach.",

His family had wanted her to go away quietly, and had written her a check with enough zeros to make that happen. \nIt was hard to find some sort of bittersweet acceptance when she hadn\u2019t just been jilted, but made to feel like somehow, she was a gold digger for accepting their payoff. It hadn\u2019t been her idea, and she hadn\u2019t been threatening to make a public stink or anything. Devin\u2019s mother had just pressed the check into her hand and said that they should all spare themselves the embarrassment and be dignified about what was happening, then walked away, leaving Charlie staring at the check in numb silence. \nThe rocky path opened onto Cleaves Cove Beach, and Charlie\u2019s shoulders eased at the sight of the empty stretch of sand. Perfect. The last thing she wanted was to make awkward small talk with tourists asking why she\u2019d come in the offseason.\nShe picked her way across the sand, noting how different it felt from the manicured beaches she was used to. This was wild, untamed shoreline, with smooth stones mixed into the sand and tangles of seaweed marking the tide line. She used her foot to smooth a flat stretch of sand and began setting up her umbrella. The wind caught it and nearly yanked it out of her hands, and she muttered some words that would have made Devin\u2019s mother sniff in patrician distaste.\nOn her third attempt, she finally got the umbrella secured and spread out her towel underneath it. The temperature hovered in the mid-sixties\u2014warm enough in the sun to be comfortable, though when the breeze picked up, it had a bite that spoke of chilly nights. Charlie settled onto her towel and opened her book, determined to lose herself in someone else's romance rather than dwelling on the cratered ruin of her own.\nShe'd made it through exactly two paragraphs when a shadow fell across the page.\n\u201cHey there.\u201d The voice was deep, friendly, and carried just a hint of a local accent. \u201cHate to interrupt your reading, but I should probably warn you\u2014this stretch of beach is private property.\u201d\nCharlie tilted her head back, squinting against the sun. The man blocking her light was tall, broad-shouldered, and backlit into a silhouette. As her eyes adjusted and he shifted his position, she took in sun-bleached hair, tanned skin, and the kind of strong features that seemed carved by the same natural forces that had shaped the coastline.\n\u201cOh no, I'm so sorry.\u201d Charlie scrambled to her feet, almost taking out her umbrella in the process. \u201cI didn't see any signs.\u201d\n\u201cEasy there.\u201d He caught the umbrella before it could become an impromptu projectile. \u201cNo harm done. The owners just get pretty territorial about their slice of paradise. They've been known to call the police on unsuspecting tourists.\u201d His smile revealed white teeth just crooked enough not to look artificial and creased the corners of his eyes. \u201cI'm Finn, by the way. Finn Morgan.\u201d\n\u201cCharlie\u2014well, Charlotte, but everyone calls me Charlie.\u201d She brushed sand from her legs, suddenly very aware that she was wearing an ancient pair of denim shorts she'd packed purely for comfort and not for aesthetics.\n\u201cTourist or local?\u201d Finn asked. His tone suggested that as a local, he\u2019d have known his own, and was only asking to obey the formalities.\n\u201cThat obvious, huh?\u201d Charlie managed a self-deprecating smile. \u201cI'm here for a week. Needed a change of scenery.\u201d\n\u201cFrom?\u201d\n\u201cBoston.\u201d She hesitated, then added, \u201cWhere I was supposed to be getting married next weekend.\u201d\nFinn's eyebrows rose. \u201cSupposed to be?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Charlie focused on folding her towel, avoiding his gaze. She wanted to add that it turned out that her fianc\u00e9 believed monogamy was more of a suggestion than a requirement, but she\u2019d deposited that check, and signed the NDA when Devin\u2019s family lawyer followed up. \u201cNot happening, now.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d The word carried genuine sympathy. \u201cThat's rough. I'm sorry.\u201d\nCharlie shrugged, aiming for casual, even though she hadn\u2019t been all that good at being casual lately. \u201cIt is what it is. At least I found out before the wedding, right?\u201d\n\u201cStill.\u201d Finn studied her for a moment, then gestured down the beach. \u201cLook, if you're wanting somewhere quiet to read, I know a spot that's actually open to the public. Better view too.\u201d\nOn one hand, she'd come here specifically to avoid people. If she went with him, she\u2019d be obligated to socialize.\nBut on the other hand, that idea wasn\u2019t as unappealing as she\u2019d expected. There was something about Finn that put her at ease\u2014maybe it was the way he carried himself, comfortable in his own skin in a way Devin never had been, for all his designer suits and carefully cultivated image.\n\u201cYou're not going to lead me to some secluded spot and murder me, are you?\u201d She gave him her blandest look.\nFinn laughed, the sound carrying over the crash and hiss of the waves. \u201cNah, murder's not really my thing. Too messy. Besides, I've got lobsters to catch later.\u201d He nodded toward a boat moored further down the coast. \u201cThat's my girl there\u2014the Mary Rose.\u201d\n\u201cYou're a lobsterman?\u201d Charlie fell into step beside him as they walked along the water's edge.\n\u201cBorn and raised. Family business.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cWhat about you? What do you do when you're not escaping wedding drama?\u201d\n\u201dGraphic design. Mostly corporate stuff, logos, branding.\u201d She didn't mention that she'd been about to launch her own firm, before everything imploded and Devin's family's hush money offered her a respite from working so she could take some time to nurse her broken heart. The NDA she'd signed felt like it was burning through her back pocket, even though the actual document was locked in her desk drawer back home.\nThey rounded a bend in the coastline, and Charlie breathed out an impressed sigh. A small cove opened up before them, protected by rocky outcrops on either side. The water here was a deeper blue, and there were some large, flat rocks that looked like someone might have dragged them out here to provide seating.\n\u201cThis is gorgeous,\u201d she said, meaning it.\n\u201cLocal secret.\u201d Finn grinned. \u201cWell, semi-secret. The tourists usually stick to the main beaches.\u201d He glanced up at the sky, which was still a brilliant, unadulterated blue. \u201cJust keep an eye on the weather. Storms come up fast around here, especially this time of year. Tide can come in real fast when the wind shifts.\u201d\nCharlie nodded, already imagining how perfect this spot would be for reading. Or thinking. Or just existing without the weight of everything crushing her.\n\u201cI should get back to the boat,\u201d Finn said. \u201cBut I'm sure I'll see you around. Small town and all that.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for the rescue.\u201d Charlie smiled, surprised to find it didn't feel forced. \u201cAnd the local intel.\u201d\n\u201cAny time.\u201d He turned to go, then paused. \u201cOh, and Charlie? Your ex is an idiot.\u201d\nBefore she could respond, he was walking away, his long strides eating up the sand. Charlie watched him go, feeling something warm unclench in her chest\u2014something that felt dangerously like hope.\nWith a shake of her head, she set up her umbrella again and settled in with her book. But her mind kept wandering from the pages to the way Finn's eyes had crinkled when he smiled, and how his voice had wrapped around her nickname like he'd been saying it for years.\nShe told herself firmly to stop it. She was here to heal, not to court more potential heartbreak. But as the waves crashed against the rocks and the October sun warmed her skin, Charlie found herself hoping she'd run into Finn Morgan again\u2014preferably before the storms rolled in.",

    "text": "Sarah Chen\u2019s fingertips waited over the keys as Congressman James Barrett\u2019s voice filled the room. The great hope of his party paced the office like a caged tiger, the sharp clap of his shoes against the polished hardwood punctuating his words. The fluorescent lights overhead cast a harsh glow on the walls adorned with framed photos of him shaking hands with farmers, veterans, and children\u2014the quintessential man of the people.\n\u201cThe American people,\u201d Barrett declared, his syllables precise and rhythmic, \u201cdeserve to know how their tax dollars are being spent. Not tomorrow, not next year, but today.\u201d He paused, his Paul Newman blue eyes locking onto Sarah. \u201cToo strong?\u201d\nSarah glanced down at the text of the speech on her laptop, the cursor blinking in sync with her quickening pulse. \u201cI think it\u2019s just right,\u201d she offered, her voice carefully measured. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 commanding.\u201d\nBarrett nodded thoughtfully and resumed pacing, the script in his hand rustling, dry and sharp against the hum of the radiator. He had a way of moving that demanded attention, every gesture deliberate, every change of posture calculated.\n\u201cCommanding,\u201d he echoed, testing the word. \u201cBut not too aggressive?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Sarah confirmed, though she wasn\u2019t entirely sure. He always sought her input, dissecting the cadence and rhythm of each line, but his questions left her feeling like she was being tested. She supposed it was flattering\u2014as a freshman aide, she never would have expected her opinion to matter to a man on the eve of a presidential campaign. But for some reason it felt\u2026 off. \n\u201cLet\u2019s tweak the second half,\u201d Barrett murmured, flipping through the pages. \u201cWhat if we reframe it? Something like, \u2018They have a right to demand transparency, because it\u2019s their money.\u2019 More personal. More immediate.\u201d\n\u201cMaking the change,\u201d Sarah promised as she typed. The new line appeared on her screen, and she read it back to him.\nBarrett closed his eyes, mouthing the words, like he was tasting them. Then he opened his eyes again, his gaze sharpening. \u201cThat\u2019ll do. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d\nSarah adjusted her glasses and scrolled down. Her job was simple: transcribe his words and be a sounding board. And yet, every time they worked through a speech, she felt that nagging unease skitter up her spine. Barrett\u2019s public persona was magnetic, his rhetoric powerful, his conviction palpable. But behind closed doors, he seemed like a different person. Not insincere, exactly, but detached, as though the fiery speeches were just lines he was delivering in a play.\nBarrett stopped suddenly, mid-pace. \u201cSarah, what about the word \u2018demand\u2019? Too harsh? Would \u2018expect\u2019 work better, or does that weaken it?\u201d\nShe hesitated, not sure she really knew. \u201cI think \u2018demand\u2019 has more weight. It\u2019s stronger. \u2018Expect\u2019 feels a bit\u2026 passive.\u201d\nThe congressman nodded, running a hand through his perfectly styled hair. \u201cGood point. Demand it is.\u201d He resumed pacing, but this time his voice was softer, almost reflective. \u201cYou know, sometimes I wonder how much people really care about this stuff. I wonder if they\u2019re really processing what I\u2019m saying, or just clapping along when my delivery tells them it\u2019s an applause line. Do you think they\u2019re even paying attention?\u201d\nShe would have been less startled if he\u2019d broken into song and dance. \u201cI think\u2026 I think they care when someone like you makes them care. You have a way of connecting with people.\u201d She hoped that was the right answer.\nBarrett smiled, but it didn\u2019t quite touch his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you to say.\u201d He resumed his pacing, murmuring lines under his breath. \nHer phone buzzed, and she jumped, fumbling to silence it. Barrett stopped mid-sentence, turning back to her with an arched brow.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI should\u2019ve muted it.\u201d\nTo her surprise, he smiled again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I needed a break anyway.\u201d He set the script down and stretched, rolling his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m going to grab some coffee. Take fifteen minutes. You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d She needed a break. She wasn\u2019t sure why these sessions unnerved her so much. The congressman disappeared through the door, leaving her alone in the quiet of the office. She picked up her phone and glanced at the screen. \nThere was a text from an unknown number. A blocked number. \nShe opened it, expecting some sort of spam.\nYour boss isn\u2019t who you think he is. If you want the truth, look for a bush near the Senate Fountain with a plastic bag caught on it. Look under it.\nFor a moment, Sarah\u2019s mind went blank. Was it a prank? Some kind of joke? She glanced at the door, half expecting Barrett to walk back in, smirking at her gullibility. \nBut if she reported it, they would trace it. Hunt down whoever had sent it. There was a whole political apparatus behind Barrett, invested in making sure that nothing tarnished the presidential chances of the party\u2019s golden boy. \nAnd on the off-chance that there was something to this accusation, she\u2019d certainly never know. \nBefore she could second-guess herself, she deleted the message, closed her laptop, and grabbed her coat.\nThe air outside was crisp, carrying the scent of exhaust and the murmur of distant traffic. The Senate Fountain loomed ahead, its water sparkling in the fading dusk light. Sarah\u2019s heels clicked against the pavement as she approached it.\nFor a moment, she was almost relieved that it had been a hoax.\nAnd then she saw it. A crumpled plastic bag, caught on the lower branches of a manicured bush. Her heart thudded as she walked over to it, glancing around to make sure no one was watching, and crouched, feeling around the bush\u2019s trunk. The area seemed deserted, but her skin prickled with the sensation of being observed.\nHer fingers brushed against something smooth in the mulch. She pulled it free: a Ziploc bag, sealed tightly, with a thumb drive inside. Her breath caught as she turned it over in her hands. No markings, no note, just the drive.\nShe stayed crouched there for a long moment. This was insane. She was an aide to one of the most prominent congressmen in the country, not some spy in an airport bookstore political thriller. But the weight of the drive in her hand felt undeniable, like a stone dropped into a still pond, sending ripples through her carefully ordered world.\nShe slipped it into her pocket and stood, brushing off her coat. \nThen, numb, she began walking slowly back to the Dirksen Building. \nWhen she reached Barrett\u2019s office, he was already back, coffee in hand, his expression as calm and collected as ever. \u201cReady to pick up where we left off?\u201d he asked. His tone was warm, easy.\nSarah nodded, forcing a smile. \nThe drive in her pocket felt hot, like it was burning a whole through the fabric and scorching her skin, even though she knew if she pressed her fingers to it, it would be cool to the touch. \nShe sat down and opened her laptop.

    "text": "The wind whipped across the exposed mountainside, carrying on its sharp and insistent edge the scent of damp earth and distant pine. Dr. Elias Vinter hunched deeper into his worn Barbour jacket, tugging the collar higher around his ears. He glanced up at the bruised grey sky, a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach. The weather had been threatening for days, slate-dark clouds hovering over the northern Norwegian momtains. The locals kept warning about sudden, violent storms.\nElias straightened his spine, pushing his worries aside. This dig, this remote Viking ship burial nestled high in the unforgiving landscape, was his focus. It had to be. \nAcademia could be brutal at the best of times, and a dry spell of publications that stretched into years was no way to get tenure. He knew his lectures were rote, a dreary repetition of well-worn material. \nAnd then there was his marriage.\nThis discovery, this excavation, was a chance to feel alive again, to be inspired to publish, to wreak some sort of hope from the wreckage of his career. \nThe site was its usual hive of activity. A team of students, their faces flushed with exertion and the chill air, carefully brushed away layers of earth, revealing more of the long, elegant lines of the buried ship. Weathered local workers moved deftly amongst them. The rhythmic clang of trowels against stone, the low murmur of conversations in both Norwegian and English, and the ever-present sigh of the wind created a constant, almost hypnotic hum.\nElias\u2019s current task was meticulously documenting the area surrounding the ship's stern. He knelt on a small, portable stool, his fingers numb with cold. He refused to wear gloves. He wanted to feel his future in the dust and ancient wood. \nThe fine, grey soil clung to everything, coating his hands, his clothes, even the lenses of his glasses. He squinted through the fogged lenses, carefully brushing away another layer of dirt from a section of what appeared to be a collapsed timber. The air was thick with the earthy smell of damp soil and the fainter, metallic tang of ancient iron.\nIt took a while before he noticed the rumbling echoing through the valley. He swore under his breath and looked up, eyeing he darkening clouds caught on the mountain peaks. A flicker of lightning cast the scene in eerie relief for a second, and the answering low growl of thunder was louder this time. The wind was picking up, tugging at the tarpaulins that partially covered the dig site.\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re in for it,\u201d a voice boomed beside him. It was Bj\u00f8rn, one of the local workers, a man built like a fortress with a loud laugh and eyes looked like they\u2019d seen things best forgotten, here in these hills. \u201cThe old gods are restless today.\u201d\nElias nodded, humoring him. He suspected the locals liked to unnerve the students with hints at dark tales from more brutal times, a gesture in the direction of the otherworldly. He, on the other hand, had had all his credulity ground away by long years of compromise and disappointment. He glanced at the other workers, who were beginning to move with a tight urgency, securing the tarpaulins and gathering their tools.\nApparently the weather wasn\u2019t going to let them continue to work. As he gathered his tools, a faint green glint in the dust caught his eye. There was a shape visible in the fine dust near where he had been working. He dropped most of his tools into his bag, keeping a soft brush out, and brushed away the fine gray dust covering the object. At first he thought it might be a shard of green glass, but it appeared to be embedded in something larger. \nHe almost didn\u2019t notice the first fat drops of rain that began to splash into the dust. The wind howled, and a clap of thunder, closer than the last few, shook the dust. \n\u201cElias! We need to go!\u201d Dr. Astrid Olsen, his colleague and the lead archaeologist on the dig, dropped a hand on his shoulder. Her voice was sharp. \u201cThe locals are saying this could turn really nasty. We\u2019ve got the site as secured as we can get it. We need to get down to the village.\u201d\nElias scowled at the scene. The sky was getting almost as dark as if the sun had set, and the rain was beginning to sheet down, rattling the tarps. The other workers were scrambling into the waiting Jeeps parked at the edge of the site. \n\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Elias told Astrid, shouting over the wind and rain. \u201cI think I found something.\u201d He gestured at the mud in front of him. The rain had washed away more of the dirt, exposing more of the object. \n\u201cWho cares?\u201d Astrid shouted back. \u201cWe need to get out of here. They\u2019re saying there are likely to be mudslides. It\u2019s not safe!\u201d\nHe knew she was right. There were rapidly swelling streams snaking down the mountainside and the tail lights of the Jeeps carrying the students and workers away were already disappearing around the curve in the road. There were two Jeeps remaining, and two local workers were climbing into one of them, shouting and gesturing at him and Astrid. But something held him rooted to the spot. \n\u201cI\u2019ll just mark this find,\u201d he said, his voice strained. \u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you. Ride down with them, leave me the last Jeep. I\u2019ll follow in a few minutes.\u201d\nAstrid hesitated, her expression torn between concern and exasperation. Finally, with a sigh, she handed him her set of keys and turned and hurried towards the waiting vehicles. \u201cYour funeral!\u201d she yelled back over her shoulder.\nElias watched them go. The rain was coming down in torrents now, soaking him to the skin. He barely noticed. His entire attention was focused on the figurine.\nAs the rain continued to wash away the soil, the figure became clearer. It was crudely carved of some dark, almost black material. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was stone or metal. It appeared to be a figure of a woman, though the details were worn and indistinct. The glint of green he had seen earlier was now revealed to be two small, cloudy green gems embedded in the figure\u2019s head, giving it an eerie, blind stare.\nHe began to carefully work it free from the earth, his fingers tracing the rough contours of its form. He found himself thinking of it as \u201cher,\u201d a strange, almost possessive thought.\nAs he gently loosened the figurine from the clinging soil, he discovered that she was mounted on the back of a small, muscular-looking warhorse. The details were crude, but there was an odd power to the lines of the sculpture. \nThe wind howled, and a sudden, ominous clattering sound made him jump. He looked up to see a nearby pile of stones beginning to slide down the mountainside, dislodged by the relentless rain. The ground beneath him was becoming saturated, the small streams around the dig site turning into rushing torrents.\nHe looked back down at the figurine, his jaw suddenly aching. He realized he had been holding a broad, almost manic grin for some time, without even realizing it. He wasn\u2019t sure how long he had been sitting there, in the pouring rain, grinning at nothing.\nWith a jolt, he snapped out of his trance. The rain was as hard to see through as fog, and the wind threatened to tear the remaining tarpaulins from their moorings. He had to get out of there.\nCarefully, almost reverently, he wrapped the figurine in the sopping towel that he had been using to clean his tools. He shoved it into his jacket pocket, the cold, wet object pressing against his chest.\nHe scrambled to his feet, his muscles stiff and aching, and squelched through the mud towards his Jeep, the wind and rain buffeting him from all sides. \nAs he fumbled with the keys, he knew one thing with absolute certainty. \nHe wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone about this find. This was his, and his alone.",

    "text": "These mountains had a way of making Elias Vinter feel small. Not the way his department head did last week, with that thin-lipped look that meant publish or perish, but something older. The wind cut through his Barbour jacket - the one Ingrid had given him years ago, saying he looked like a proper archaeologist now. The memory stung worse than the cold.\nDark clouds massed above the peaks. He'd learned to read weather at dozens of dig sites across three continents, but these Norwegian storms were different. The locals knew it. He caught their glances, the way they watched the sky like they were expecting something. Their warnings about the mountains' moods had seemed quaint three weeks ago. Now, not so much.\nThe Viking ship emerged from the earth like a secret telling itself. His students worked with more enthusiasm than skill, and sometimes he had to look away, remembering his own early disasters. That site in Peru, when he'd nearly destroyed a pristine textile layer. His old mentor would have known exactly what to say about their technique. But his old mentor wasn't speaking to him these days, not since the Uppsala controversy.\nHis knees cracked as he shifted on his camp stool, documenting the stern section. The soil here had its own personality, clingy and grey, turning everything it touched into a ghost of itself. Something about the texture reminded him of the chalk dust that had covered his hands after lectures. Back when he still cared enough to gesture.\nThe first tremor caught him mid-thought. Thunder rolled through the valley like a giant's hunger. Lightning sketched the ship's outline in brutal clarity, and for a moment he could see it as it must have been - proud and terrible, bearing its dead to eternal rest. The tarps snapped overhead like sails in a storm he'd rather forget.\nBj\u00f8rn appeared like a mountain taking human form. \u201dThe old ones are walking.\u201d His voice carried the weight of generations who'd learned to fear these peaks. Elias started to nod, but something in the soil caught his eye.\nGreen. Just a flash, like broken bottle glass, except...\nRain began falling, fat drops that meant business. More thunder, closer now. He kept digging. His fingers remembered other artifacts, other discoveries that had meant everything until they didn't. His last paper rejection sat unopened in his email. Ingrid's lawyer was still waiting for a response. None of it mattered. The green thing in the dirt pulled at him like an unfinished sentence.\n\u201dElias!\u201d Astrid's voice cut through the wind. She never showed fear - it was one of the things he'd first noticed about her as a project lead. But fear threaded through his name now. \u201dThe locals are calling it! We need to clear out!\u201d\nHe looked up. When had it gotten so dark? The crew ran for their vehicles, abandoning tools like a sinking ship. Rain painted everything in sheets of grey.\n\u201dJust give me a minute.\u201d His voice sounded strange in his ears. \u201dThere's something here.\u201d\n\u201dThe whole slope could go!\u201d The terror in Astrid's voice should have meant something to him. Should have.\n\u201dI'll follow in my Jeep.\u201d A lie told itself through his mouth.\nHe watched their taillights bleed into the rain. The mountain shuddered. The thing in the ground waited.\nThe figure emerged from the earth like a birth gone wrong. Dark material, not quite stone, not quite bone. A woman astride a war-horse, crude but powerful. The green stones set in her face weren't eyes - they were hunger made visible. They stared at nothing, at everything. At him.\nHis hands moved without permission. The figure came free. Recognition hit him like vertigo - not of the thing itself, but of what it meant to want something so badly you'd let the mountain fall around you.\nHe wrapped it in his cleaning cloth, the one still stained with coffee from countless mornings of shaking hands and delayed decisions. Pressed it to his chest like a confession.\nThe rain tried to blind him as he fought his way to his Jeep. The dig site dissolved behind him. Years of careful work turned to mud and memory.\nThe figure rode against his heart, a secret turning into truth. The mountain's judgment followed him down into darkness.",

'Insist' sounds too... polite.\u201d\nHe nods, runs fingers through that perfect hair. Then his voice shifts, goes soft like old velvet. \u201dDo you think anyone really cares about these details? Are they even listening?\u201d\nThe question catches her off-guard. Thread of doubt in his voice she's never heard before. \u201dI think... they care when someone makes them care.

    "text": "The thing about October in Maine is it smells like endings. Charlotte Eastwick stood at the edge of the water, breathing in salt and dead seaweed and that weird smoky smell that shows up right before winter, and tried not to think about how she should've been back in Boston right now, arguing with the florist about last-minute substitutions for the peonies that hadn't bloomed in time.\nThe wind kept trying to steal her umbrella. Beach umbrella in October - jesus, what was she even doing here? But the alternative was sitting in her rented cottage reading through the NDA one more time, like maybe this time she'd find a loophole, something that would let her tell the whole world exactly what kind of man Devin Morrison turned out to be. His parents' check had a lot of zeros, though. Enough zeros to shut up about their precious son and his extracurricular dating habits.\nThe trees up here were already mostly bare, which felt appropriate. Back home they'd be showing off, all gold and red and look-how-pretty-dying-can-be. Here they just gave up and got it over with, branches clawing at a sky so blue it hurt to look at. Charlie adjusted her death grip on her beach gear - umbrella, bag, that stupid romance novel she'd bought that morning. The bookstore clerk had looked at her purchase (novel, chocolate bar, more chocolate) like she was one sad indie movie away from adopting seventeen cats.\n\u201dBad breakup?\u201d the woman had asked, in that particular New England way that somehow made it both a question and a statement.\nCharlie had managed something between a smile and a grimace. How exactly do you explain that your fianc\u00e9's \u201dnetworking events\u201d turned out to be more horizontal than vertical? That his mother had shown up at your apartment with a checkbook and a contract, talking about \u201ddiscretion\u201d and \u201dfamily reputation\u201d like she was casting The Godfather?\nThe rocky path dumped her out onto Cleaves Cove Beach, which stretched empty in both directions. Thank christ. She really couldn't handle one more conversation with helpful tourists asking why she was vacationing alone, their faces doing that awkward dance between sympathy and judgment when she mentioned the canceled wedding.\nThis wasn't one of those neat, managed beaches with imported sand and carefully spaced chairs. Nature had dumped whatever it felt like here - smooth stones, chunks of driftwood, tangles of seaweed that looked like mermaid hair gone wrong. It took Charlie three attempts and more swearing than strictly necessary to get the umbrella planted in a way that wouldn't send it cartwheeling down the beach.\nThe temperature was playing that fun fall game where it's simultaneously too hot and too cold. Charlie spread out her towel in the umbrella's shade, pulled out her book (shiny cover, bare-chested man, absolutely zero infidelity plot twists guaranteed), and managed exactly two paragraphs before a shadow fell across the page.\n\u201dSo here's the thing.\u201d The voice above her was pure Down East, warm and rich as good coffee. \u201dYou're technically trespassing.\u201d\nCharlie tilted her head back and immediately regretted it as the sun blinded her. When her vision cleared, she found herself looking at the kind of man L.L.Bean probably had locked in a basement somewhere for catalog photo shoots. Tall, broad-shouldered, with that sun-bleached hair and weathered skin that said he actually worked outside instead of just playing at it on weekends.\n\u201dOh god, I'm sorry.\u201d She scrambled up, nearly decapitating herself with the umbrella in the process. \u201dI didn't see any signs.\u201d\n\u201dWhoa, easy.\u201d He caught the umbrella before it could complete its mission of death. \u201dNo big deal. Just wanted to warn you before Mrs. Henderson calls the cops again. She's got nothing better to do than police her precious beach frontage.\u201d His smile made it all the way to his eyes, creating the kind of crinkles Devin probably had Botoxed away. \u201dI'm Finn. Finn Morgan.\u201d\n\u201dCharlie. Well, Charlotte, but nobody calls me that except my grandmother and people trying to sell me things.\u201d She brushed sand from her legs, suddenly very aware that she was wearing the kind of shorts that should have been retired during the Obama administration.\n\u201dLet me guess. Boston?\u201d\n\u201dThat obvious?\u201d\n\u201dLittle bit.\u201d The way he said it made it feel like a shared joke instead of an accusation. \u201dWhat brings you up the coast?\u201d\n\u201dCanceled wedding.\u201d The words just fell out of her mouth like stones. \u201dNext weekend, actually.\u201d\nHis eyebrows did a thing. \u201dDamn. That's rough.\u201d\nCharlie focused very hard on folding her towel. \u201dYeah, well. Turns out monogamy was more of a suggestion than a requirement for him.\u201d\n\u201dChrist.\u201d He managed to pack a whole paragraph of sympathy into one word. \u201dLook, there's a public beach just around that bend. Better spot anyway. The view's something else.\u201d\nShe should say no. She came here specifically to avoid people, not to follow gorgeous strangers to secondary locations. But there was something about him that felt... safe. Real. The opposite of Devin's careful polish and practiced charm.\n\u201dYou're not going to murder me and dump my body in the Atlantic, right?\u201d\nHis laugh bounced off the water. \u201dNah, got a boat full of traps waiting. That's my girl down there - Mary Rose.\u201d\nSomehow they were walking, falling into step like they'd done it before. He asked what she did (\u201dGraphic design, mostly boring corporate stuff\u201d), and she asked about lobstering (\u201dFamily business, since my grandfather decided farming was too easy\u201d). She didn't mention the design firm she'd been about to launch, or the way Devin's mother had smiled when Charlie signed away her right to tell anyone why the wedding was really canceled.\nThe beach he led her to was straight out of some travel magazine's \u201dHidden Gems of New England\u201d spread. A perfect little cove, sheltered by rocky arms, with water so blue it looked painted. Someone had even arranged the rocks into natural benches.\n\u201dLocal secret,\u201d Finn said, looking pleased at her obvious appreciation. \u201dJust keep an eye on the weather. Storms come up fast this time of year. Like, really fast.\u201d\nHe had to get back to his boat, but he turned back before he left. \u201dHey Charlie? Your ex is what my mother would call a complete goddamn waste of oxygen.\u201d\nShe watched him walk away, all easy grace and broad shoulders, and felt something crack open in her chest. Something that felt like maybe the universe wasn't completely done with her yet.\n*Stop it*, she ordered herself. She was here to put herself back together, not to fall for the first beautiful stranger who smiled at her like she mattered. But as she settled back with her book, she caught herself hoping she'd run into Finn Morgan again. Preferably before those storms he'd mentioned rolled in and washed away all traces of this strange, perfect morning.",

    "text": "I awoke to unfamiliar luxury: clean sheets, smelling of flowers that dot the countryside here, which children call \u201cLady\u2019s Veil.\u201d The flowers\u2019 wistful scent was said to ease troubled sleep.\nThere was an old folksong about a young man who met a maiden in a field and, overcome by her grace, clasped her close and attempted to pull back her veil. She changed shape six times, each form more deadly than the last. In her seventh form, the edge of her veil sliced him open like a blade. She fled into the forest, and he followed, his blood mingling with the flowers that bloomed beneath her feet, leaving the center of each pale blue blossom stained crimson. I\u2019d heard young girls tell it as a tragic love story, and old men cite it as a parable about the glory and danger inherent in loving the divine. \nPersonally, I thought it was a good warning for people who can\u2019t keep their hands to themselves. \nA vague memory of seeing the school in the distance late last night, bone-weary after a week\u2019s ride from the site of our last job and the incessant squabbling of my companions, teased me. I thought I remembered the school\u2019s healer shooing me into bed. \nI was home, or the closest thing I had to it.\nThe sunlight was slanting in through the leaded diamond panes of my window, but I was still languorous with the remnants of well-earned sleep. I had just slithered onto my stomach and pulled the sheet over my head when the breakfast bell began ringing.\nBother.\nResentful, I climbed out of bed. I pulled on a pair of soft leather breeches, a white linen shirt, and my boots, then a vest that concealed a few daggers and my thieves\u2019 tools. Sliding another dagger into each boot, I headed downstairs for breakfast.  \nThe hallways were largely devoid of the normal morning bustle. I did see a bleary-looking Pepwinn dragged from his room by his starved-looking wolf, but I skipped down the stone stairway before he could greet me.\nAt the bottom of the stairs, I stuck my head into the storeroom that led into the kitchen. A harried-looking cook paused in sorting through a barrel of dried fruit to look inquiringly at me. \u201cOne more for breakfast,\u201d I told her.\nShe nodded, a chestnut curl falling into her eyes. \u201cExtra ham for you, healer says, Miss Elspeth,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cDon\u2019t be looking sour at me, young miss.\u201d I tried to put my face back into a pleasant expression. \u201cHealer says you\u2019re almost all used up, and need to be building back your strength. Tain\u2019t worth it to argue with a healer, lass – good ones are right bullies, they are.\u201d She couldn\u2019t have been much older than me, but I dropped my chin meekly and agreed. \u201cInto the hall with you, now, and I\u2019ll have your meal out to you in a trice, and you\u2019ll clean your plate, and neither of us will have to answer to Her Healerness.\u201d\nI turned to go, then looked back over my shoulder. \u201cLiss, who made up my bed? Someone scented the sheets with lady\u2019s veil flowers, and I wanted to thank whichever housekeeper was so thoughtful.\u201d\nHer blue eyes widened, and she beamed. \u201cThat were Jenta, the head housekeeper\u2019s daughter. You been in her gaze e\u2019er since you showed her how to pick the pantry lock – \u2019n yes, we know it were you, so don\u2019t bother denying. The little maid heard the other students saying as how you should be home soon, and how you\u2019d cleared the risen dead out of that tomb and saved the town. She were worried you\u2019d not sleep easy after bumping noses with ghosts and ghouls and rats and the like, so while the other children were playing she slipped off and gathered the veilflowers. Then she nipped at Meyla\u2019s heels until she washed the sheets with the petals. The little one\u2019s a right angel, I say, and I wish me younger sisters were half as sweet.\u201d\n\u201cPlease pass my thanks to Meyla,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll find Jenta and thank her myself, and try to avoid corrupting her with any more lockpicking lessons.\u201d\n\u201cSee as you do,\u201d the cook huffed, grinning. \u201cNow away with you. I\u2019ve your breakfast to get.\u201d\nI opened the door to the Great Hall and was met with a wall of sound woven of the voices of the other nineteen students in residence at the school (eighteen more maintained rooms at nearby inns) and the clanking of dishes and utensils.\n\u201cElspeth!\u201d called Luthar, the closest thing I had to a friend, from one of the long, scarred tables. \u201cHere, I saved a place for you.\u201d I slid onto the bench next to him, and he poured me a glass of cider from the pitcher shared by our half of the table. \nThe table quieted and my classmates leaned in. \u201cWell?\u201d Luthar demanded. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t glorious,\u201d I told my audience. \u201cMost of it was wet, cold and unpleasant.\u201d\nThey looked disappointed, so, seizing this rare moment of rapport with my classmates, I gave in and regaled them with a slightly embellished version of the cleansing of the tomb. Looking around at their shining eyes, I started to feel a bit strange about just how impressed they were. All I\u2019d really done, after all, was exactly what we\u2019d all been trained to do. The hero-worship from the people of the village had been more or less expected, but seeing the same from my peers was unnerving. The whole reason we were all here was to learn real survival and exploring skills, the stark realities unvarnished by all the nonsense bards sing about. \nThe Academy wasn\u2019t the sort of fighting school that young people outside of our little country dream of attending. Announcing you\u2019d been a student there wasn\u2019t likely to score you free drinks from callow would-be adventurers in taverns across the region. It wouldn\u2019t draw lovers intent on bedding a hero. You wouldn\u2019t be able to trade on school ties to step into an otherwise unearned command post with an army or mercenary troop. \nArturus\u2019s academy boasted one feature that the sort of school that offered those benefits usually couldn\u2019t, however: a large contingent of retired—that is, still-living—alumni throughout the region.\n\u201cSo, anyone have any interesting plans for after graduation?\u201d I asked, wanting my classmates to go back to looking at me like I was one of them. \nLuthar traced the grain of the table, scarred with use and names and slogans from generations of hungry students, with a broad finger. He was from Alvar, the biggest metropolis in the region, and his parents had sent him to the Academy to learn the skills needed to follow in their footsteps as explorers and treasure-hunters. He was, I imagine, a perfect presumptive candidate: polished, urbane, and irrepressible. \nHe was also in giddy, stultifying love with a pretty young woman from the local village of Stardale, and in serious discussions with her family about marriage and eventually taking over their farm. He was clearly thinking about her now, because he wore a slightly poleaxed smile.\nCari, a tiny woman with a curly mop of hair, smiled with a bright flash of teeth. \u201cGoing back to my troop. They\u2019ll have to take me seriously now that I\u2019ve been here.\u201d She was a member of a successful mercenary group and was looking forward to a commission. \nThe others at the table were locals, planning to join the militia which was the closest thing the country had to a government. \n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Cari asked me. \u201cWhat does the future hold for the mysterious Elspeth?\u201d\nI felt my eyebrows make a grab for my hairline. \u201cMysterious\u201d was one of the last words I\u2019d choose to describe myself. \u201cI was planning to head to Alvar and try to find a merc troop that\u2019ll take me.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re done with our heroine,\u201d a new voice broke in from immediately behind me, \u201cI need her elsewhere.\u201d\nI jumped several inches off the bench and twisted my neck over my shoulder. Professor Nura El-Ameen, priestess of the sun goddess and our tutor in protection spells and dealing with outsiders, beckoned graciously to me, as if it were merely a request. \u201cBring your breakfast, Elspeth. You\u2019re looking a bit wan,\u201d she added. \nProfessor El-Ameen came from a far-off desert empire. In contrast to the stereotypes about desert princesses, the professor dressed plainly. A closer look at her robes, however, told an observer that this was no novice priestess; while simple, they were of fine silk, pale blue with a subtle but ornate gold sunburst pattern that only revealed itself when the light hit it at certain angles. \nI offered the occasional prayer and coin to the goddess of fortune because it made sense to have a good relationship with the lady of luck, but I wasn\u2019t particularly religious. The professor, however, whatever ecstatic rites she might be rumored to practice in private, projected such an air of quiet common sense in public that it was only natural to go to her for advice, and she never tried to convert us.\n\u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d I asked her as she guided me from the great hall. \n\u201cQuite the opposite,\u201d said the professor. \u201cA young woman from the village is here and wishes to convey her town\u2019s gratitude to you, both verbally and, I think, in a more tangible form. She\u2019s waiting in the parlor. How are you feeling, by the way? Any lingering aches or abrasions from your experience?\u201d \n\u201cDan took most of the damage,\u201d I demurred, although I couldn\u2019t help flexing my elbow and wincing. \nThe professor\u2019s dark eyes narrowed at the movement, and she stopped me as we walked through a shaft of sunlight into the hallway. She stared out at the sun, the strong lines of her profile softening and her eyes turning amber as she murmured a quick invocation to her goddess. \nThe sunlight wrapped around me as if it had weight and substance. The heat of it should have been uncomfortable, but it felt friendly instead. It melted through my skin, purring along my bones and brushing away the last of the tomb\u2019s chill. The pain in my elbow faded, and a sense of perfect well-being enfolded me. \nI opened my eyes, though I didn\u2019t remember closing them. Motes of dust danced in the light, forming a sparkling veil over the priestess. She was smiling up at the sun. The dust motes swirled around her merrily, gleaming like miniature suns, as if the goddess were also enjoying the exchange. \n\u201cNo more, please,\u201d I said dryly, \u201cor you might tempt me into apostasy, and anyone in my line of work shouldn\u2019t get on the lady of fortune\u2019s bad side.\u201d My voice came out hoarsely, as if I\u2019d just awakened from a deep sleep. \u201cYou worship a dangerous goddess, professor.\u201d   \nProfessor El-Ameen\u2019s eyes cooled into their normal dark brown as she turned them to me, and something crossed her face, though whether it was quick-hidden laughter or pain, I couldn\u2019t say. \n\u201cAll gods are dangerous.\u201d",

You\u2019ve been in her gaze ever since you showed her that lock trick – and yes, we know it were you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThe little maid heard you\u2019d cleared that tomb of walking dead. Worried you wouldn\u2019t sleep easy, she gathered veilflowers while the other children played, then convinced Meyla to wash your sheets with them.

The torchlight caught on something neither mist nor bone. It moved with liquid grace, still wearing burial finery, a gold circlet gleaming on its skull.\u201d I paused, enjoying their rapt attention. \u201cWhen it lunged for Dan—I\u2019ve never seen a man his size move so quickly in retreat.\u201d\nTheir shining eyes made me uneasy. They looked at me like I was something more than them, when all I\u2019d done was survive what we\u2019d all been trained to survive. The Academy wasn\u2019t some romantic fighting school producing heroes; it produced survivors. Its achievement wasn\u2019t glorious graduates but ones who reached old age—rare in our profession.\n\u201cSo,\u201d I said, changing the subject, \u201cplans after graduation?\u201d\nLuthar traced the table\u2019s grain absently. From Alvar\u2019s upper circles, he\u2019d come to follow his parents\u2019 path as treasure-hunters—polished, urbane, perfect for the role. Instead, he\u2019d fallen for a village girl and now discussed taking over her family\u2019s farm, wearing a poleaxed smile at the thought.\nCari, tiny but fierce, grinned sharply. \u201cBack to my troop. They\u2019ll take me seriously now that I\u2019ve trained here.\u201d She anticipated a commission in her mercenary company.\nThe others planned to join the local militia, our region\u2019s closest thing to government.\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Cari asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s next for the mysterious Elspeth?\u201d\nMy eyebrows shot up. \u201cMysterious\u201d hardly described me. \u201cI\u2019m heading to Alvar to find mercenary work.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re finished with our heroine,\u201d came a voice behind me, \u201cI need her elsewhere.\u201d\nI jumped, twisting to see Professor Nura El-Ameen beckoning. \u201cBring your breakfast,\u201d she added. \u201cYou look wan.\u201d\nThe professor, from a distant desert empire, defied stereotypes. Her robes were simple in cut but exquisite in material—pale blue silk with a subtle gold sunburst pattern visible only in certain light.\nI respected her practical wisdom though I wasn\u2019t religious myself. She never proselytized despite her deep devotion to the sun goddess.\n\u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d I asked as we left.\n\u201cQuite the opposite. A village representative awaits you with thanks and, I believe, something tangible.\u201d Her eyes assessed me. \u201cAny lingering injuries?\u201d\n\u201cDan took most of the damage,\u201d I said, though I flexed my sore elbow.\nThe professor\u2019s eyes narrowed. She stopped where sunlight streamed through a window, her profile softening as she murmured to her goddess.\nThe sunlight seemed to gain substance, wrapping around me with gentle heat. It melted through my skin to my bones, washing away the tomb\u2019s lingering chill. My elbow\u2019s pain vanished as perfect well-being enfolded me.\nI opened my eyes to see dust motes dancing in the light around the priestess, forming momentary patterns before dispersing. She smiled upward, communing with her deity.\n\u201cNo more,\u201d I said hoarsely, \u201cor you might tempt me into apostasy. Those in my line can\u2019t risk angering the lady of luck.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cYou worship a dangerous goddess, professor.\u201d\nEl-Ameen\u2019s eyes returned to their normal brown as she regarded me thoughtfully.\n\u201cAll gods are dangerous,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s whether they\u2019re dangerous on your behalf that matters.\u201d She motioned me forward, her robe\u2019s golden threads catching light like trapped stars. \u201cSome dangers, Elspeth, are worth courting.\u201d",
